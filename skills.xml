    <string name="skill_craft">Craft %s</string>
    <string name="skill_craft_description">Base Rating: 0%\nMaking and repairing sophisticated tools and structures. A job that most people could figure out does not require the Craft skill, only an INT or DEX test.

Use it to disarm a bomb, set a charge to destroy a target remotely, jury-rig an explosive from supplies at the hardware store, or analyze a blast to determine exactly what caused it.

Having 20% allows halting conversations; at 50% your Agent speaks and reads like a native.

You don’t need to roll a Foreign Language skill unless the Handler says the situation is exceptionally difficult.</string>

Use it to remember or find a key fact about the distant past, recognize an obscure reference, or comb a database or library for information that nobody without your deep education could find.

    <string name="skill_humint">HUMINT</string>
    <string name="skill_humint_description">Base Rating: 10%\nHuman intelligence. This obtains information about a subject—especially information the subject would rather conceal—through observation, conversation, or examining patterns of behavior and relationships. Use HUMINT to recognize signs of dishonesty from verbal cues and body language, gauge attitude and intentions, cultivate sources of information about a subject, determine what it would take to get a subject to cooperate, or recognize clues of what a subject wants to conceal. HUMINT can notice signs of mental illness, but Psychotherapy would be needed to diagnose and treat a specific malady. If your Agent also has Criminology, HUMINT can be used to compile a psychological profile to help find a subject. A subject who deliberately tries to deceive your Agent can attempt a Persuade test to oppose your Agent’s HUMINT (see OPPOSED TESTS on page 45).</string>

    <string name="skill_occult_description">Base Rating: 10%\nThe study of the supernatural as understood by human traditions, including things like conspiracy theories, fringe science, and cryptozoology. Use Occult to examine and deduce the intent of a ritual, or to identify occult traditions, groups, grimoires, tools, symbols, or legends. Occult can never tell an Agent what’s genuinely unnatural and what’s just superstition or mythology. That’s the province of the Unnatural skill.</string>

    <string name="skill_persuade">Persuade</string>
    <string name="skill_persuade_description">Base Rating: 20%\nChanging another’s deeply-held decision or desire. Use Persuade to get your Agent’s way when the subject is so stubborn, what your Agent wants is so valuable, or the deception is so flagrant that Charisma isn’t enough. With Persuade, your Agent might convince a witness that what she saw was innocuous and not unnatural, talk a detective into helping you cover up evidence for the greater good, or draw useful intelligence out of an unwilling subject. This skill also allows your Agent to resist persuasion and interrogation in opposed Persuade rolls (see OPPOSED TESTS on page 45).</string>

    <string name="skill_pharmacy">Pharmacy</string>
    <string name="skill_pharmacy_description">Base Rating: 0%%\nKnowledge of drugs, from their ingredients and creation, to their effects, uses, and misuses.

    <string name="skill_ride">Ride</string>
    <string name="skill_ride_description">Base Rating: 10%\nHandling, training, and riding an animal—horses, donkeys, camels, whatever. Exotic mounts may need special training (see page 30). Use it to keep safe on an animal in a crisis and to keep riding animals safe, calm, and healthy.</string>

    <string name="skill_science">Science %s</string>
    <string name="skill_science_description">Base Rating: 0%\nThe deep study of the processes of the world. This is more than common schooling; anyone can attempt an INT test to remember something from a high-school science class.

Each Science is a separate skill: Astronomy, Biology, Botany, Chemistry, Engineering, Genetics, Geology, Mathematics, Meteorology, Physics, Planetology, Zoology, etc.</string>

    <string name="skill_search">Search</string>
    <string name="skill_search_description">Base Rating: 20%\nFinding things that are concealed or obscured from plain sight. Searching a scene may not require the Search skill, only time and effort, or a sufficiently high INT.

The Handler may roll the Search attempt so you don’t know whether your Agent succeeded or failed.</string>

    <string name="skill_sigint">SIGINT</string>
    <string name="skill_sigint_description">Base Rating: 0%\nSignals intelligence.

    <string name="skill_surgery">Surgery</string>
    <string name="skill_surgery_description">Base Rating: 0%\nThe treatment of an injury or abnormality by invasive means. By comparison, First Aid keeps a patient alive until surgery is possible and Medicine ensures longterm recovery. (See HEALING on page 55.)</string>

    <string name="skill_unarmed_combat">Unarmed Combat</string>
    <string name="skill_unarmed_combat_description">Base Rating: 40%\nSelf-defense. A fight between untrained combatants often involves more shoving and shouting than real violence. Use Unarmed Combat to hurt or kill an opponent with your Agent’s bare hands (or feet, elbows, teeth, or head).</string>

    <string name="skill_unnatural">Unnatural</string>
    <string name="skill_unnatural_description">Base Rating: 0%\nKnowledge of the fundamental, mind-rending secrets of the universe. Use it to remember, recognize, or research facts about the things humans consider unnatural. This goes far beyond the occult, because the Unnatural skill represents things that are real. Use it to sift through the darkest parts of myth and folklore and recognize which of it is true. Your Agent’s SAN score can never be higher than 99 minus his or her Unnatural skill rating.</string>
