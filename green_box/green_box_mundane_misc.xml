        <item>A one gallon Mason jar full to the brim with assorted change - everything from pennies to silver dollars. At the Keeper\'s option, there is between $100-$300 in the jar, but because it\'s all in change it\'s inconvenient as hell to actually pay for anything with it all.</item>

        <item>Two packets of cigarettes.</item>

        <item>A large cardboard carton containing a dozen sealed MREs (US military field rations in heavy plastic pouches) dated 1986. Mmm, "LOAF, HAM &amp; CHICKEN" and freeze-dried fruit cocktail.</item>
        <item>Several pairs of handcuffs whose locks have been sabotaged to be unable to be unlocked once put on the wrists. This isn\'t immediately noticeable without proper inspection, and the (clearly home-made) packaging bills them as "joke cuffs".</item>
        <item>A plastic bag containing a set of clean and neatly folded clothes: a pair of black jeans, a black t-shirt, a pair of white panties, a dark-red blouse and a pair of white socks. All in size Small.</item>

        <item>A VHS videocassette labelled "Innsmouth Surveillance 7/92." Playing the tape shows that it\'s actually a copy of "Sweatin\' to the Oldies" starring Richard Simmons.</item>
        <item>A Cookie tin filled with sewing needles. there is one spool of red string atop them.</item>
        <item>A large dayglo-colored golf umbrella that looks as if it\'s seen better days. A rather-long length of coax cable is wrapped around the umbrella like some sort of sheath to hold the ribs closed. If the cable is unwrapped and the umbrella is opened, the agents will find that someone has painstakingly glued pieces of aluminum foil to the fabric on the inside. A small yagi antenna affixed with a couple of pipe clamps brazed to the spine of the umbrella state its purpose: a makeshift radio reflector, suitable for contacting communications satellites clandestinely. The antenna\'s emitted RF bounces off of the foil inside the umbrella, and received signals are bounced off of the foil and focused on the yagi.</item>
        <item>A spindle of CD-R disks, each of which has a small amount of information on it (judging by the refraction pattern on the data side). If booted on a 32-bit PC, the legend DARIK\'S BOOT AND NUKE will appear, along with an easy to follow menu.\nDBAN is a software application for securely erasing (\'clearing\' in DoD parlance) the hard drives of computers by laying down successive patterns of meaningless bits and pseudorandom junk to make it infeasibly difficult for a forensic analyst to recover any data.\nThere are enough disks to wipe sixty machines at a time, assuming that the cell has physical access and is nimble enough to run from machine to machine.</item>
        <item>A broken silver chain with a small silver Thor\'s Hammer attached.</item>
        <item>A large wooden crate that was pried open some time in the past. 48 MRE\'s; Twp of each type found in the 2003 US military \'MRE menu\'\nThey are in mint condition, and will cause no [out of the ordinary] Ill-effects.</item>

        <item>Toolkit\nThis is the usual kind, with tools useful for Mechanical or Electrical Repair, and Electronics rolls as well as paraphernalia for an innovative session of interrogation. Such kits can often vary greatly in size, and some are small enough to fit in plainclothes or tactical packages. The most common though fit into a plastic or metal two-tray kit, and include screwdrivers (an electrical driver with a set of heads is good), nails, nuts and bolts, cables and wires, a hammer, chisel, electrical tape, G-clamps, wire cutter and stripper, cable stripper, folding hex and torx key set for the screwdriver, pocket multimeter, needle-nose vise grips, telecomm scissors, and a set of jumper cables.</item>
        <item>An accordion folder filled with takeaway menus from all over the United States, carefully filed and organized. A few seem to date back to the 1920\'s and 30\'s.</item>

        <item>An Oxford box, numbered "4", containing a portion of the records from a now-closed funeral home in Kingsport, TN. The records are mostly receipts from plot sales and cremations.</item>
        <item>Snakelight\nThough not as durable as a Mag-Lite or as handy as a pocket light, a Snakelight can be folded over a seat to shine down on a passenger seat (equipment\scanners or maps), wrapped around your neck to illuminate what you are working on, or just coiled to stand on it\'s own to light up the job at hand.</item>
        <item>A bottle of generic-brand aspirin, containing 100 tablets.</item>
        <item>A small red USB key with a paper tag dangling from the keyring. The paper tag reads "Keep an eye on this! It may come in handy in the future!"\nIf plugged into a fairly modern computer, the USB key is found to contain a PDF of step-by-step procedures for converting a number of common rifles into full auto weapons. Other files on the USB key contain instructions for fabricating the necessary components to do so in a metal shop. A subdirectory contains all of the necessary schematics that can be fed into a number of 3D printers to fabricate the components in a (well stocked) basement workshop or hackerspace.</item>

        <item>A ziploc bag with gift cards from several major box store realtors (WalMart, Target, Best Buy, etc); they total up to several thousand dollars over more than a dozen stores.</item>
        <item>A large cloth bag labeled "USPS-MRC, Atlanta, GA." If opened, the bag contains approximately 2,000 unopened pieces of mail addressed to people and business throughout the United States. Investigation would reveal that the bag came from the USPS Mail Recovery Center, or dead letter office, where undeliverable mail is sent to be destroyed or auctioned.</item>

        <item>A large hockey bag containing a complete set of clothing for surviving in arctic conditions.</item>

The corner is covered in plastic sheets, upon which a thick layer of dried blood and small bits of gore has coagulated into a horrifying lacquer. There are even flecks of it on the walls. And that\'s not even mentioning the smell, which is indescribably nauseating.</item>
        <item>A fully fueled and well-maintained dirt bike, with dried mud crusted on its tires.</item>

        <item>1 box of Tic-Tac brand mints, containing 14 cinnamon flavored mints.</item>
        <item>1 dozen small tiki torches</item>
        <item>An empty plastic guitar-case.</item>
        <item>There are several stacks of plywood against one of the walls.</item>
        <item>A Pack of Black Jack chewing gum. Slightly stale, this gum\'s pungent anise and black liquorice flavor is an acquired taste.</item>
        <item>The first thing the investigators notice upon opening the Green Box is a large bomb sitting on a plain folding chair in the center of the room, with a very theatrical LCD screen counting down to zero from around thirty seconds.\nWhen it "explodes", all the lights in the Green Box flick off at once, then back on, and the countdown changes to "HA, GOTCHA! -C" Upon inspection, it is only a mockup of a bomb, although everything but the explosives themselves is quite real and professionally-wired. When they close the door to leave, the timer will reset, ready to terrorize the next cell.</item>
        <item>Two dozen HOOAH! energy bars, in either apple-cinnamon or chocolate flavor.</item>
        <item>A rolled up bodybag made from heavy black rubber.</item>
        <item>A clear plastic box which has been marked and sealed with red biohazard tape. Inside a torn open envelope is visible.</item>
        <item>3 bottles of Jack Daniels,</item>
        <item>A small brass statue of the Hindu god Hanuman, a package of incense sticks, a Bic lighter, and a small incense holder, also in brass.</item>
        <item>This is a cloth moneybelt hanging over an unfolded chair. The first pouch contains fifty 500 Euro notes. The center two pouches contains 43 $1000casino chis from a local casino. the fourth pouch contains fifty U.S.$100 bills.</item>
        <item>An orange prisoner\'s overall.</item>
        <item>A one pound package of pure heroin stamped with a golden snake.</item>
        <item>A heavy claw hammer.</item>
        <item>6 Magnesium Flares in a small waterproof case.</item>
        <item>A children\'s ceramic piggy bank (unopened). Peering carefully into the slot with sufficient light will reveal that the bank is crammed full of paper bills. Breaking open the bank will net the cell $385 in fives, tens, and twenties (and one Canadian quarter).</item>
        <item>3 cap vials of amyl nitrate.</item>
        <item>A large roll of yellow tape with biohazard markings.</item>
        <item>An index finger sevred at the knuckle, examination shows faint calluses which could be attributed to a quite active trigger finger. tests show signs of gunpowder, the fingerprint can be connected to prints found on countless different handguns found through out the years dating back to the 1920\'s when the practice was first put to use, but no identity or DNA profile has ever been conected to the print.</item>
        <item>At the back of the storage unit there is a barred window, to allow light in. The bars have been cut and replaced with a paper Mache facsimile. There is a ladder resting on a nearby wall, which can be used to make a quick exit through the window. The window is small and will easily fit someone of petite size. Those with an athletic build could squeeze through but would have to remove all their gear. Perhaps even make this a roll to see if they can get through. The window exits into a service walkway between the storage units. One end is blocked with an AC unit but the other has a service door that can be opened from the inside without a key. This hidden exit can be used to escape pursuers, bring in items secretly or to double back or ambush attackers. As a downside, it also means the box is less secure then it should be.</item>
        <item>A black ski mask.</item>
        <item>An unactivated smart phone.</item>
        <item>A DVD+R disk containing dozens of transformation fantasy stories from the Internet. About half of the stories involve transforming into Deep ones, and some include fantasies involving encounters with shape-shifting shoggothim. 2/1D6 SAN, no mythos.</item>
        <item>A medium-sized adjustable pipe wrench.</item>
        <item>A basic military-issue gasmask.</item>
        <item>A blue T-shirt. On the front is an eagle clutching an AK-47 in it\'s claws over a banner that reads \'U.S. Postal Workers Union. Dial 911."</item>
        <item>1/2 50lb bags of Fast-set Quikrete</item>
        <item>A pair of plain leather gloves, medium-sized</item>
        <item>A large collection of carpentry tools sits in the Green Box, as well as a layer of sawdust and several pieces of scrap plywood.</item>
        <item>The keys to a latest-model BMW sports car, and directions to a public garage where it is ostensibly parked down to the specific parking spot (including photos). Upon arrival, all that can be found is an empty space and a light dusting of window on the ground.</item>
        <item>A set of AN/PVS-7 Night Vision Goggles. Needs new batteries (2x AA)..</item>
        <item>A locked suitcase containing a folded up Service Uniform for a US Marine Corps Lieutenant, a pair of black leather gloves and an envelope with newspaper clippings about a serial killer called the "Tampa Bay Strangler" who killed at least four young women in the Tampa Bay area four years ago. The uniform and the gloves have been meticulously cleaned.</item>
        <item>An unopened carton of Gauloises</item>
        <item>One wall and the back of the green box are obscured by large stacks of plain grey cinder blocks, commonly used to build the foundations of houses. Carefully taking down and setting aside two or three columns of cinderblocks will reveal a six-inch gap behind the stacks in which the firearms of the green box have been hidden.</item>
        <item>Wet-Naps\nYou can never be too clean...</item>
        <item>A past visitor has left his or her pet snake in the Green Box, and it has escaped its terrarium to slither about among the box\'s contents. It is non-venomous and not one of the massive constrictor species, so the only real danger is in startling a group of armed and very jumpy individuals.</item>
        <item>A 500ml glas bottle containing a clear liquid. A handwritten note on it says: "Solution = LySergic acid Diethylamide / Water / Alcohol".</item>
        <item>Upon entering the green box, the agents notice a tall figure dressed in black and clutching a large metal device aimed at the door. Closer inspection will reveal that the figure is a life-sized cardboard cutout of former US President Bill Clinton wearing jazz blacks and holding a tenor saxophone.</item>
        <item>The Green Box is filled to the brim with styrofoam peanuts; removing them reveals an inner Green Box containing other items.</item>
        <item>Several bullet holes pockmark the Green Box\'s walls, suggesting a firefight took place within at some point in the past.</item>
        <item>The Green Box contains a fully stocked reloading bench.</item>
        <item>A solidly built wooden dresser with three drawers, Each 3 feet wide, two feet long, and 6 inches deep.\nEach drawer contain a dozen vacuum sealed packages.

Every item is colored an even dark blue.\nThe top Drawer contains Large sized packages, The middle Drawer contains Medium Sized Packages, The bottom Drawer contains Small Packages.\nAll items are durable and easy to clean.\nIn the back of the bottom Drawer lies a small note stating "Eventually smell of lemons, Be warned." in clean and tight handwriting. This is true.</item>
        <item>Every object in the Green Box has been mixed into a large dumpster filled with trash; most of them have been wrapped in plastic, but the more fragile equipment may be damaged or broken.</item>
        <item>A pocket-sized lockpicking set.</item>
        <item>A Mace Windu action figure.</item>
        <item>A framed black and white photograph of president Nixon.</item>
        <item>A vinyl record of experimental industrial band Coil\'s 1984 single, "How to Destroy Angels". It is in excellent condition.</item>
        <item>A box of kevlar Ballistic vests with ceramic inserts. They appeared to have been used, but not damaged. The vests are bulky and difficult to conceal, and initialed from various law enforcement agencies.</item>
        <item>A plastic baggie containing a dozen insulin syringes (with needles) and three vials of thorazine. The labels and seals are intact but there is nothing to suggest where they may have been acquired from.</item>
        <item>A half-full 32 oz. spray bottle of Windex.</item>
        <item>Refrigerator: several batteries (1d10 for # of: AAA, AA, C, D, 9 volt), 1d10-unopened cans of beer and soda, spoiled food, 1d8 bottles of various chemicals (some unidentified). Freezer: ice, cold packs, package of burritos (6 months old), 1d8 Hungry Man meals</item>
        <item>A California state flag hangs on one wall of the Green Box.</item>
        <item>The original soundtrack to the film Blade Runner by Vangelis. Repressed on red translucent vinyl.</item>
        <item>A 1` stainless steel ruler, completely unscathed except for a small nail driven through at the 10`` mark.</item>
        <item>One of the corners of the Green Box has many dried bloodstains on the floor, as well as a an equally bloody chair with remnants of duct-tape restraints. Judging by the nearby end-table bearing a CD player with \'Stuck in the Middle with You\' on pause, a straight-razor, and a shriveled-up severed human ear (0/1d2 SAN), it seems someone genuinely re-enacted the warehouse scene from Reservoir Dogs.</item>
        <item>A case of \'Crystal Pepsi\' from 1993. Its street value is on the order of tens of dollars.</item>
        <item>A pair of elegant black high-heeled shoes (size small).</item>
        <item>A small paper package containing eight communion wafers.</item>
        <item>4 cases of lighter fluid</item>
        <item>An assembled OpenPCR open source DNA sequencer.</item>
        <item>A black briefcase filled with piles of fake $100 bills. The fakes are quite bad (presumably printed out on a laser colour-printer) but could possibly appear real at a distance.</item>
        <item>A wallet which contains only $23.37 in mixed bills and change.</item>
        <item>A set of hypodermic needles and a few vials of hospital-grade sedatives.</item>
        <item>Two 5-lb bags of soda lye.</item>
        <item>A stack of expensive looking business cards for a outfit called the International Consultation and Advisory Group, an NGO that "Advises state actors on evolving situations in the twenty-first century." The logo is embossed in festive green foil. Six or seven generic sounding names (picked at random from LinkedIn searches) and various positions within the NGO are represented in the stack.\nThe NGO is a shell incorporated and registered within the Washington, DC area. If the agents decide to check the shell\'s bona fides they\'ll discover that the cover is very tight and well constructed. Agents familiar with the NGO community of DC will immediately find this suspicious because most NGOs don\'t run that tight a ship to begin with.\nThe business cards provide sufficient cover for infiltrating conferences, symposia, and off the books "Chatham House Rules" think tanks and training sessions so long as the agents don\'t do anything too strange (like open fire on people standing around the coffee urn).</item>
        <item>A simple magnetic compass.</item>
        <item>Eight exterminators\' jumpsuits, with a non-existent pest control company\'s logo embroidered on the left breast of each. Also included are eight respirators which conveniently conceal just enough of one\'s face to conceal the wearer\'s identity.</item>
        <item>The Green Box, and everything in it, smells strongly of gasoline.</item>
        <item>A half-full bottle of tequila. Smells like the Mexican dead. There is a post-it note on it: "SANDRA, 2002 - It was not in vain." On the reverse, it says: "If you don\'t replace the booze, may the Bronsons shit on your lawn."</item>
        <item>Lined paper torn from a spiral notebook with hand written instructions and diagrams detailing how to siphon gasoline out of a car\'s fuel tank. A length of rubber hose is coiled nearby.</item>
        <item>A small roll (20 feet) of razorwire.</item>
        <item>A wristwatch with the face painted with glow-in-the-dark paint. The paint contains radium, making the clock slightly radioactive but harmless (unless the paint is ingested).</item>
        <item>A battered cardboard satchel containing the plans for Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, circa 1973. Entrances and routes to a box overlooking homeplate are marked in pencil, and notes indiciate a security detail of some sort around the box. Also included are three ticket stubs to the December 19, 1976 Colts-Steelers game and a 1975 flight map of the Baltimore area.</item>
        <item>A pair of blood-spattered pliers.</item>
        <item>One corner of the Green Box has been prepped for a water-boarding session. A stretcher with wrist and ankle restraints lies on the ground next to multiple gallon jugs of water, many of which are empty, and a cotton towel is draped over a nearby object, as if to dry. A message has been written in pink sidewalk chalk over the setup:\n"If you use this, remember this place ain\'t sound-proof."\nKeeper\'s discretion on whether or not the stretcher, floor, and towel are still damp when first found.</item>
        <item>A stack of refill cards for various providers\' pre-paid cellular phones held together with a pink rubber band. A LUCK roll determines whether or not the cards are past their expiration dates.</item>
        <item>Arriving at the Green Box agents find a patrol-car and two uniformed police officers poking around outside. They\'re actually following up an anonymous prowler report unrelated to the Green Box itself, but they\'ll ask the usual questions of anyone nearby before moving on. Investigators acting suspiciously may pique their interest, however; especially so if they start waving their badges or guns around...</item>
        <item>Plastic 2-gallon canteen.</item>
        <item>A sealed plastic trashbag full of dirty crapped underwear.</item>
        <item>An opened package of Tamiflu antibiotic pills. Nine pills remaining.</item>

        <item>A Boston EMT uniform.</item>
        <item>A large brown recliner with a distinctly 80s floral print has been dragged into the corner. Investigation will reveal nothing unusual about it. It is quite comfortable and there is a dollar in change in the cushions.</item>
        <item>A 2006 Kawasaki Ninja 250 motorcycle in candy plasma blue with valid license plates for whatever state the box is in. It has a full tank of gas, a white full-face Shoei helmet locked to the seat, and keys in the ignition.</item>
        <item>A shoebox containing plastic blanks and a partial roll of front and a partial roll of back laminate for Wisconsin drivers licenses. A sample driver license, made out to John Smith with a birth date of April 1, 1993 and an address in Madison, WI (the address of the U.W. Madison\'s Memorial Union, if anyone checks) and using a photograph of former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson is included. A printed note reads: "You are on your own for the camera. I am seriously risking prison just getting you guys this stuff!"</item>
        <item>Spray Paint, three cans. Red, blue and green.</item>
        <item>Two hollowed out Bibles. One is empty, the other contains a handful of peyote buttons.</item>

        <item>Half a dozen US Army battle-dress uniforms, fully equipped with all proper patches and insignia, along with gas masks and military-grade CBRN protection gear. A Military Science roll will reveal the uniforms are of the 48th Chemical Brigade.</item>

        <item>A plastic bucket (with lid) containing 16 lbs of quicklime.</item>
        <item>A black prison inmate slip-on shoe stuffed with nine hi-vis orange military grade chemical light sticks</item>
        <item>A large shoebox marked \'MAYOR\' in black sharpie.\mInside is a manila folder, a film canister, and a kitchen knife wrapped in wax paper and caked with dry blood. The folder contains photographs of a man arguing with a woman in a kitchen, then stabbing her with the knife. The film canister contains negatives of the same photographs.\nThe man photographed was mayor of the city about 10 years ago. His wife \'disappeared\' during that time. He is now reclusive and very difficult to track down.</item>
        <item>A large plastic bag containing a carefully folded dress uniform for a US Air Force Captain.</item>
        <item>A non-descript black briefcase with a simple combination lock. It is empty but for a post-it which says "code:1111".</item>
        <item>6 1-gallon bottles of store-brand bleach.</item>
        <item>Three full two-gallon cans of gasoline.</item>
        <item>An unopened bottle of Old Overholt rye whiskey (dated 1986) and four dusty shot glasses</item>

        <item>Box of lemonheads</item>
        <item>A non-firing replica of a Glock 17 pistol. It may be used as a threat perhaps.</item>
        <item>A whiteboard with dry erase markers. There is nothing except for a green triangle drawn on the top corner.</item>
        <item>Tactical Radios\nModern "walkie-talkie" radios usually work two-way, have a range of 2-5 miles, and are now small and light enough to fit comfortably in the average jacket pocket. Digital encryption, frequency hopping, and whisper operation are also possible with some high-end models. Many of these radios can be fitted with a hands-free setup, and some can be clipped to a belt and used with an earplug receiver and wristband mic for plainclothes communications.</item>
        <item>Five framed posters for Japanese \'yakuza eiga\' films from the 1960s hang on one wall of the Green Box.</item>
        <item>A small selection of battery chargers for Motorola, Nokia and Ericsson mobile phones. Useless unless the phones are from the late 90\'s.</item>

        <item>A Dutch oven.</item>
        <item>A monster mask, crudely cut to cover the eyes only. It is fastened together by clothespins on the back</item>
        <item>A five gallon plastic bucket about three quarters full of coarse, white power. A paper label on the side of the bucket reads "J-Lube Veterinary Lubricant."\nThis stuff is what it says on the sticker: Dehydrated veterinary surgical lubricant, suitable for easing the birth of horses, calves, and pigs. Adding one ounce of powder to two gallons of water will turn it into a large quantity of thin, incredibly slippery slime that is harmless to living things. Unless some of it is spilled on a relatively smooth floor, in which case twisted ankles and fractures are practically assured.\nNote that instructions for using the stuff are nowhere to be found in the greenbox, which will probably lead to puzzled looks, scratched heads, and Internet searches. A forgiving Keeper is recommended to bring up episodes of Mythbusters and stupid college dorm stunts. A less forgiving keeper may wish to be as purient as the players will permit. Either of these options will hopefully give the players ideas for offensively using this incredibly slippery substance (from contaminating water supplies to making getaways much more interesting).</item>
        <item>A pair of small binoculars.</item>
        <item>5 football jerseys, XL-sized, for five different college football teams.</item>
        <item>4 sealed boxes of Trojan condoms.</item>
        <item>A standard barrel full of crude oil. Unopened.</item>
        <item>A large punching bag has been suspended from the ceiling in the center of the Green Box. It\'s clearly seen its share of use, and a throwing knife is stuck in the side at eye level. Someone even took a red Sharpie and doodled some blood dripping down from the wound.</item>
        <item>A variety flavor pack of high-energy Powerbars,</item>
        <item>A case of cheap beer.</item>
        <item>A large, commercial-sized stainless steel refrigeration unit. Once opened, it is apparently a miniature blood bank, with about 20 O- blood bags. Along with this is a pair of IV stands, and a small collection of tubing and transfusion equipment.</item>
        <item>An entire pallet of Maruchan brand Cup of Noodles. It looks fresh off a delivery truck, besides a hole in the plastic wrap and a few missing cups in the top right corner. A note taped to the noodles reads "Picked up on a mission. Don\'t ask, just eat. I\'m sick of them - XYLANDER"</item>
        <item>A four-feet length of heavy chain and a padlock with key.</item>

        <item>A canvas diaper bag with empty bottles, unopened powder formula (still good), three new pacifiers, and a rattle.\nNearby are six packages of twelve diapers in various sizes.</item>
        <item>A small set of tools (tweezers, pen knife, lock pick, tension wrench for the lock pick, flat blade screwdriver, Philips screwdriver, and needle file) disguised as a large, ball point pen with a black metal barrel. When assembled as a pen, the device actually writes.</item>
        <item>A Texas state flag hangs on one wall of the Green Box.</item>
        <item>Two rolls of toilet paper in a ziplock bag</item>
        <item>A large manila envelope with the text "DIRT" on the front. Inside can be found a ziploc bag with several borderline pedophiliac magazines, a set of ten explicit pornographic photos of various children and a pair of surgical gloves.</item>
        <item>A reasonably fat roll of used banknotes.</item>

        <item>Alphabet fridge magnets. The letters C and T are missing.</item>
        <item>A strip of cloth about two feet long and an inch and a half wide. The cloth is half white and half red. Closer inspection reveals it to be a hachimaki. Keepers might want characters that seem a little too gung-ho to get hold of it.</item>
        <item>A Betamax copy of the Carol Reed movie "The Third Man".</item>
        <item>A barrel of sulfuric thats almost empty.</item>

        <item>A battery powered Milwaukee Sawzall and a selection of new metal, masonary, and butchering (technically, for large game) blades for same. When you absolutely, positively want something to not be there, this is the tool for the job.</item>
        <item>A 20\' bass boat on a trailer has been parked next to the Green Box; the keys are hanging from a nail immediately inside the door.</item>
        <item>A "Don\'t Tread On Me" flag.</item>
        <item>A complete set of basic scuba diving gear, including a mask, wet-suit, weight-belt, and half-full air-bottles.</item>

        <item>A lawnmower blade.</item>

        <item>A foot long strand of garlic.</item>
        <item>A stack of Obama campaign signs. If they were stolen, kept here before being put out, stored for some random reason or because of some evil they would work, is unknown. Their reason for being here is up to the GMs imagination</item>

        <item>A small plastic bottle, marked "PotIod", containing fourteen 130mg potassium iodide pills, as used to protect the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine during nuclear accidents.</item>
        <item>A very compact but powerful electric furnace, used for smelting scrap metal in ceramic flasks. The furnace runs on 220 VAC so it can\'t be used inside the green box. Stuffed into a cardboard box near the furnace is a pair of welder\'s gloves, long steel implements for handling a hot flask, three spare flasks (wrapped in paper), and a set of ceramic and graphite molds, suitable for making candy bar-sized ingots of metal.</item>

        <item>Petzl Zipka Plus-2 headlamp with 3 brightness modes plus strobe and auxiliary red LED.</item>
        <item>A checkbook for one Susan Doe, with a local bank. The address is a vacant lot and the name is bogus, but the account has about $1500 in it and has been inactive for about five years.</item>

        <item>3 kilos of cocaine</item>
        <item>A cheap coffee maker of the sort you could buy in a grocery store for a couple of bucks and think nothing of it. The coffee pot is roughly a quarter full of something that once was coffee and the rest is full of rank greyish-green mold. You\'re not sure if throwing out the coffee pot would help clean up the place or be considered an act of genocide.</item>

        <item>A large box of Kleenex tissues.</item>
        <item>A shoebox full of business cards for every plumbing contractor in Rhode island and southeast Massachusetts. Most of them are out of business, but roughly 10% are still active.</item>
        <item>Two dirty yellow nylon gym bags, each containing many fist-sized bundles of US currency in small bills (twenties and fifties). Each bag totals out at $25,000us.\nWhat the agents don\'t know is that all of this is marked currency that came from a DEA sting that went bad. A DEA squad was about to bust a Delta Green mythos organization of the Keeper\'s choice when the Delta Green cell that normally takes care of this green box killed everybody on site (operating under the assumption that anyone involved with the group in question had to be taken out) and salvaged what they could.\nThe serial numbers for every one of the bills in the transaction are marked and flagged in a DEA database, so if the agents try to use any of the money to buy anything legitimate they\'ll have the DEA coming down on them like a ton of bricks in a couple of days.</item>

Inside the box is a single blister pack that originally held 10 tablets, now with only eight tablets remaining. The other box is unopened.

Folded carefully in the back seats are three state troopers\' uniforms (two women\'s, one men\'s), along with the badges, utility belts, handguns, radios, etc. needed to complete the disguise.\nRunning the vehicle\'s VIN number shows that it was written off as totaled following a collision on a back-country road, and if the vehicle is examined closely signs of extensive repairs are evident.</item>

        <item>Nikon Reflex camera.</item>

        <item>Box of 300 large strike-on-box kitchen matches.</item>
        <item>The entirety of the Green Box has been rearranged to make it a defensible position; furniture and crates have been stacked into barricades and cover, secondary entrances have been blocked off, and a wide table has been overturned in front of the door to make it extremely difficult to enter. There is absolutely no sign of who did this, but it appears the climactic fight they expected did not happen.</item>
        <item>A six pack of Bud Light, with 1d6 beers missing.</item>
        <item>A waterproof shell jacket.</item>
        <item>A paper bag containing a bottle of bathing-salt, a bottle of Absolut Vodka, a box of painkillers, a package of razor blades and a note saying: "Along, not across.".</item>

        <item>A bundled up black trenchcoat, size Large. There is a group of three small holes on the lower right back of it. The fabric is heavily stained with dried blood around the holes.</item>
        <item>A snake recently found its way into the Green Box somehow, and has been trapped inside for some time. It is now hungry and agitated, and any investigator who isn\'t careful while going through the Box\'s contents will probably find its hiding place the hard way. It is unlikely to be a venomous snake, however, unless the Keeper is feeling sadistic.</item>
        <item>A basic police-frequency radio scanner.</item>
        <item>A compact, man-portable copying machine that has been crudely jury-rigged to draw power from twelve D-cell batteries. Needless to say, it\'s not the most efficient power setup, an the batteries need to be swapped very often.</item>
        <item>Four uniforms of the local police department, pne each of men\'s extra-small, small, medium, and large sizes. They are complete with badge and gun belt, though no pistols, nightsticks, pepper spray, etc.</item>

        <item>A homeless man is sleeping in this green box. He is severely mentally ill and may attack if awakened suddenly. If questioned he will reveal that he broke into the building and began squatting there two weeks ago. During that time he sold as much of the contents as he could to various pawn shops and fences in the area. He can give only vague descriptions of the items and where he took them.</item>
        <item>It looks as if some of the agents that maintain this Green Box have gutted a large (professional) kitchen microwave and replaced the magnetron with a sizable electromagnet easily the size of two five pound coffee cans end to end. A bank of 0.5 farad capacitors have been wired to the leads of the coil and attached to the top of the microwave with epoxy. Something unspeakable has been done to the timer module of the microwave, presumably to convert it to manipulate the king-sized electromagnet. The microwave\'s 220V power supply appears to be intact.\nSomeone has scrawled instructions on the door of the homemade degausser from hell with a black Sharpie: PLACE ELECTRONICS IN CAVITY, CLOSE DOOR, SET TO \'POPCORN\', HIT START.\nIf the agents decide to try using the degausser they\'ll have to figure out where to plug it in first (the green box doesn\'t have a 220V line). Upon setting the dial to POPCORN (the other pre-programmed settings don\'t do anything) a loud humming sound will emit from the degausser for a minute or two. Then a very loud bang will emanate from the degausser\'s guts: this is not an explosion but whatever the agents put into the unit to wipe suddenly leaping up and slamming into the electromagnet at high speed when the magnetic pulse goes off. At the keeper\'s option, personal electronics and magnetic storage media not put into the microwave will be wiped as well.</item>
        <item>1 space pen and pad of Rite in the Rain All-Weather writing paper</item>

        <item>A plastic bag containing a complete Santa Claus outfit, including a large fake beard and a wig.</item>
        <item>The key to the Green Box doesn\'t work: investigators will either have to force the lock (and perhaps bring undue attention to themselves) or find another way in.</item>
        <item>The Green Box is a pig-sty: investigators have to pick through dirty rags, unwashed clothes, wastepaper and rotting food cartons in order to find anything useable among the mess.</item>
        <item>A sturdy nylon net, as used by dog-catchers to entangle medium- to large-sized dogs. There are some tears in it, but it still looks functionable.</item>

        <item>Black &amp; Decker CCS818 Chainsaw, weighing about 6 pounds, 18 Volt NiCd battery for 150 inch cuts, cordless, and 7 inch cut capacity. Battery is already charged, and appears mildly used.</item>

        <item>An old camping sleeping bag. It smells faintly of body odor, but is very comfortable.</item>
        <item>An eSATA write-protection box, as used by computer forensics team to avoid tainting hard-drives they are working on.</item>

        <item>A small battery-powered CD-player with two matchbox-sized loudspeakers.</item>
        <item>A stack of cardboard shipping boxes from several chemical supply companies containing one gallon plastic jugs. Some of them contain bottles of sulfuric acid (10 molar concentration) and some of them contain hydrogen peroxide (10 molar concentration). For every jug of sulfuric acid there are three bottles of hydrogen peroxide.\nThese are the ingredients of piranha solution, a chemical compound which is highly corrosive to organic compounds (such as cell samples or corpses). It can be used under some circumstances to reduce a corpse to bones and lots of icky, toxic black crud. It can also cause grevious bodily harm in the event of accidental exposure by dissolving flesh while still attached to the character.\nAt the Keeper\'s discretion, appropriate safety gear (hazmat coveralls, face shields, rubber gauntlets) may be found in the greenbox. Players should make a Chemistry or Biology roll to recognize the combination of reagents and know the proper safety precautions for making and using piranha.</item>

The trashbag reads "WARNING - BIOHAZARD - DISPOSE OF PROPERLY," and is filled to near-overflowing with bloody bandages, soiled clothing that appears to have been cut off of the wearer, wrappers from various and sundry disposable medical paraphernalia, empty phials and used syringes. Splinters of textured red plastic can also be seen scattered about the medical waste and floor of the greenbox.\nA stickynote affixed to the wall above the biohazard container reads "Could you throw this out when you get a chance? Thanks!"</item>

        <item>A Black&amp;Decker electrical power drill with a 8mm titanium drill-bit attached.</item>
        <item>The Green Box smells strongly of oil (PCs familiar with firearms will know it as the distinctive odor of Hoppe\'s No. 9), and a space has been cleared in the center of the floor to set up a gun cleaning area. A fairly extensive kit is neatly laid out and a small stack of used patches lie in a bucket, but one of the bottles has been spilled and not cleaned up.</item>

        <item>A large-ish leatherette zippercase. Opening the case reveals a complete set of dissecting instruments, of the sort that a medical school student would use in class.

        <item>A box of ammunition for a Barret M82A1 sniper rifle. Each bullet has been lovingly hollowed out with a drill press and the cavity packed with a mixture of plastique and a homemade detonator made out of lead azide. A small blob of paraffin wax was used to plug the front end of the bullet.\nPlease note that this is actually a very, VERY bad idea, and if actually fired the bullet will probably blow up in the chamber and maim, if not kill the sniper outright. DG agents do some very outlandish things when their SAN gets too low...</item>
        <item>4 20lb bags of charcoal briquettes</item>
        <item>One can of silly string, half used.</item>
        <item>10 liters of concentrated hydrochloric acid.</item>
        <item>Due to the general comings-and-goings of shady out-of-town types (namely: the investigators), the Green Box has become a mythologized "haunted house" to local schoolkids.\nUpon arrival at the Green Box a failed LUCK roll, by the unluckiest character present, results in the investigators being spotted by a gang of (1D4+half the number of agents present) schoolkids. Like any self-respecting Scooby Doo fans, these kids do everything in their power to uncover the secrets behind the Green Box and its visitors...</item>
        <item>3 six-packs of Yoo Hoo chocolate soda.</item>
        <item>If the investigators haven\'t been careful, and have been overtly speaking about aliens and such in public, a UFO conspiracy nut will attempt to covertly follow them to the Green Box.</item>
        <item>A ziploc bag containing a small vial of Apidra insulin analogue and a sterile syringe.</item>
        <item>Several handholds and crevices have been built into the wall of the room containing the Green Box, making it into an improvised rock-climbing wall.</item>
        <item>A battered, scuffed, dusty, fake-leather satchel containing $120,000 in bundles of crisp pre-2005 US $100 bills.</item>
        <item>A trace of the serial numbers will reveal that this money came from the cash shipments the US government sent to the new Iraqi government in 2004, which then went missing.</item>
        <item>A Swiss Army knife, with a sticky-note: "Shit, wished I had a Leatherman."</item>

        <item>A well-worn Korchmar brand 14.25" x 18.5" x 5.75" attache case in full-grain dun-coloured leather with solid brass hardware. Within are fake, well-traveled British, Canadian, and American Passports for two of the PCs, as well as over 250 in Euros and 1000$US tucked away in various compartments. Two BlackBerry Bold 9000s nest in the cellphone pouches, containing dummy contacts routed to friendlies briefed to expect calls/sms/email from the agents. The case is loaded with props appropriate to an investment bank\'s mid-level executives. There are dossiers for two well-fabricated identities tailored to fit the PCs. Friendlies in a legitimate investment bank home office will substantiate these identities.</item>
        <item>Pre-paid Nokia X2 cellular phone, with a single programmed, Nevada telephone number, 91 minutes remaining on the account.</item>
        <item>A paper bag containing three large rat traps.</item>
        <item>2 gas lamps</item>
        <item>A standard-size business card made out of thin silvery metal. Upon closer inspection, the \'card appears to have been made out of spring steel, and has been carefully machined to consist of a thin framework of spars from which you could punch out a set of lockpicks. The picks aren\'t terribly good, you might get one use out of them if you\'re lucky, but in a pinch they might come in handy.\n"JAMES GREEN, PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS" is engraved on the metal where possible, along with an address (foreclosed house), phone number (pre-paid cellphone, LUCK roll for the phone to be in the green box and still have some airtime on it), and an e-mail address (hushmail.com).\nKeeper\'s choice whether or not to give the PC a chance to avoid cutting themselves while they try to pick a lock and leave blood/DNA evidence all over the place.</item>
        <item>Five unused white envelopes.</item>
        <item>A M84 stun grenade mounted on a bed frame just inside the door. It has been setup to allow an agent to pull it off a nail and quickly deploy it.</item>
        <item>Three boxes of Yehuda brand matzos, two sealed jars of Manischewitz gefilte fish and a small silver butter knife.</item>
        <item>A large (6x6 inch) polished metal mirror attached to an extensible metal pole (15 feet long) at a slight angle with a couple of cheap plastic casters attached at regular intervals. A Maglite has been duct-taped to the pole so that it shines directly into the mirror when it\'s turned on. It appears to be the sort of tool used to search the undercarriages of vehicles for bombs or contraband.</item>
        <item>A small package of Dramamine (for countering motion sickness) with six tablets left.</item>
        <item>Some paranoid fuck has wired the entrance of the Green Box to the pin of an M33 Delayed Fragmentation hand-grenade.\nAn agent opening the entrance needs to make a SPOT HIDDEN roll in order to notice the wire\'s existence (simply cutting the wire is enough to stop the boobytrap detonating). Failing an ad hoc defusal, everyone present has 4 seconds to say their prayers. It should go without saying a hand grenade in an enclosed space is going to be rather destructive to anyone and anything in the Green Box and surely attract unwanted outside attention...</item>
        <item>A cheap fire detector. It is still functioning, though the batteries are quite low.</item>
        <item>A ten-gallon container of industrial strength cleaning liquid.</item>

        <item>1 Pickaxe</item>
        <item>One complete MOPP suit (woodland camouflage), still sealed in the manufacturer\'s packaging, with an M40 mask, two sealed filters, and three ATNAA autoinjectors. If worn, will protect the user from most conventional chemical weapons, from tear gas to nerve agents.</item>
        <item>Two camping cots with cold weather blankets.</item>
        <item>Two boxes of waffle mix, and a waffle iron.</item>
        <item>7 blank ID\'s for local minor officials and amenities (water, power, animal control) and a laminating machine.</item>
        <item>A large (3\' x 5\') poster showing the only known photograph of De Loy\'s Ape.</item>
        <item>Inside the green box sits a chest of drawers, the contents of which are at the DMs discretion. However taped to the bottom of the top drawer is an address, a note and a key. The address is a key to Woody\'s hotel in Spanish Fort Alabama. The hotel was closed years ago at the city\'s request and is now boarded up. On the side opposite the road you will find the key opens a green door. The door itself will still need to be freed from the 2x4s securing it but the players should have an easier time with the door open. The room has seen better days but the note points you to the ceiling. Where several pistols and a MAC 10 await</item>
        <item>A cloth bag full of dozens of four-sided dice and tied with a leather cord. A note attached to the cord reads: "Step One: Throw in path of bad guys. Step Two: Run like hell. -S"</item>

        <item>20kg of sodium cyanide crystals.</item>
        <item>A poster displaying instructions on disassembling and reassembling a Kalashnikov rifle hangs on the wall of the Green Box. The text and labels are all in Russian, but the operation itself is simple enough to be virtually foolproof, and with enough practice can be done in less than thirty seconds.</item>
        <item>$100 worth of marijuana</item>
        <item>2 Sledgehammers</item>
        <item>5 pair surgical latex gloves in paper wrappers.</item>
        <item>A package with four of AA batteries.</item>
        <item>A box of randomly-assorted vinyl records in varying states of quality. Which exact songs are found in the box can be up to the Keeper, but they include popular Beatles songs, music by a number of jazz artists, and more. They would sell for a fair price.</item>
        <item>A single black tee-shirt that has, in bold white lettering, "BLACK HOLES ARE OUT OF SIGHT" printed on the front.</item>
        <item>One bite sized Snickers bar. Melted.</item>
        <item>A cardboard box containing 22 old-style metal pocket hand warmers, each with it\'s own red flannel bag. All are unopened and unused. There appear to be two missing from the box. There is also a one gallon can of Ronson brand lighter fluid. This has been opened and is half evaporated.</item>

        <item>List of missing people with several highlighted. Attached is a few pages for each highlighted case, revealing that they all went missing in the same town.</item>
        <item>The Green Box reeks of chemical fumes, and any investigators who begin to remove things without letting it air out or without using proper respiratory equipment will have to roll against POT 14 toxins or suffer from turpentine poisoning.</item>
