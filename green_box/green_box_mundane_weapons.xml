        <item>Several late-model cavalry sabers, mostly American Model 1913 "Patton" sabers. Each one is authentic, but also very well-maintained and just as ready for combat as the day they were forged.</item>

Box also contains a crudely machined and finished, but very effective silencer that fits the threads, several magazines for the pistol, and a few dusty old partial boxes of .22 ammunition, perhaps 50-60 rounds total.

        <item>A Stoeger Coach Gun. This double-barrel shotgun is chambered for 20-gauge shells, and several vertical lines have been carefully drawn on its stock and barrel in grease pen.

There are also a half dozen or so FAL mags in the footlocker, painted to match the pattern on the rest of the gun and two sealed "battle packs" of 7.62x51mm NATO rifle ammunition, each ten 20-round pasteboard boxes sealed in airtight heavy green plastic; the markings on the packaging and the headstamps on the cartridges indicate they were manufactured in Portugal in the 1980s.</item>

        <item>An Artillery model Luger pistol, complete with wooden stock/holster and 32-round snail drum to make it an antiquated but functional carbine. It would, of course, fetch thousands on the collectors\' market.</item>
        <item>A drum that\'s been turned into a massive improvised pyrotechnic device. Stenciled on the side is a around pointing down. If opened it will be found to have been filled with an oil gas mixture as well as a homemade napalm. It is designed to set the mixture alight and then allow it to flow out a hole in the bottom.</item>
        <item>A pair of Beretta PM12S 9mm submachine gun with a metal folding stock - 6 40-round magazines are included.</item>
        <item>A small bottle of Pepper Mace Spray.</item>

        <item>A civilian-legal Uzi carbine, with 16-inch barrel and fixed wooden stock. This particular model is chambered in .22LR, and fires in semi-automatic only. Six magazines for it are present, along with a block of 500 .22LR rounds.</item>

        <item>A police shoulder holster containing a Manurhin MR-73 Revolver in .357. It is fully loaded, with six spare rounds attached to the holster. The serial number on the gun and the name sewn into the holster match that of a french police officer who vanished in 2006.</item>
        <item>An old Mosin Nagant M1891/30 sawn down into an "Obrez" configuration for easy concealment. The base of the grip has a hand-made sling attached to it. A full 5 round clip of 7.62x54mm R is nearby.</item>
        <item>A full shipment of fifty M9-pattern bayonets, still in the original manufacturer\'s crate. It was evidently rerouted here before it entered the Army\'s supply chain.</item>

The pistol rests in a cardboard box along with an original English language advertisement.</item>
        <item>An empty pizza box. Any investigators who open the box discover a fully loaded MAC-10 submachine gun. A note scribbled onto the inside of the box reads "She\'s dead" (in the language of the Keeper\'s choice) repeated 1d100 times.</item>
        <item>A suicide-bombers vest with four blocks of C4 plastic explosives on the front and a dead-mans-grip detonator. There are cut up pieces of silver forks, spoons and other eating utensils duct taped to the explosives.</item>

        <item>Wrapped in oiled cloth is a large and heavy S&amp;W M1937 .45 ACP caliber revolver, showing some signs of wear but in excellent mechanical condition. Its serial number has been filed off, which is a shame because collectors pay a lot of money for them these days, but it\'s illegal to sell it through "normal" civilian channels with a defaced serial number. Also present are two dozen three-shot "half moon" clips for it; it is normally loaded with a pair at a time for a total of six. No ammunition is present, but this caliber is relatively common, at least in the US.</item>
        <item>A Taurus Judge revolver in a Western-style leather holster. Someone has painted the cylinders with an alternating red/black pattern, and when popped open the logic can be seen: each cylinder painted red is loaded with a .410 shotgun shell, and each cylinder painted black contains a .45 LC round.</item>
        <item>2 Unertl MEU SOC 1911 .45 semi-automatics with two spare clips each.</item>
        <item>A Vietnam War-era Claymore anti-personnel mine.</item>
        <item>A Ruger Red Label 12ga. over-and-under shotgun with 26-inch barrels.</item>
        <item>Several drop guns. All are pistols involved in crimes in the state of Arizona.

Except for one finger print on the internal mechanisms and whatever finger prints the players leave on them.</item>
        <item>A Glock 17, one round chambered and three in the magazine.</item>
        <item>Five steel-bladed machetes with different blade styles, types of handles and lengths.</item>

        <item>A tray of seven stoppered glass vials, each containing white powder. The powder is weaponized anthrax, from stocks held by the Rhodesian government during the Apartheid era. There is space for an eighth, missing, vial...</item>

There are also eight 30-round straight magazines, all loaded with 180-grain jacketed hollowpoints inside the case.</item>
        <item>A DeLisle silenced carbine in .45 ACP, made during the Second World War. No magazines or ammo are present for it, however it does use the relatively common (at least in the US) .45 ACP pistol cartridge and the same magazines as the M1911A1 .45 pistol.</item>
        <item>A fully loaded (30 round) Heckler&amp;Koch MP5K 9mm submachinegun with a laser-sight attached.</item>
        <item>A 12 gauge Stoeger Model 2000 semi-automatic shotgun with a 18.5 inch barrel and a black synthetic pistol grip stock. Comes in a carrying case along with 6 five-round boxes of 00 buckshot.</item>
        <item>An broken hand air pump for bicycles.\nCloser inspection shows that the "air pump" is actually modified to fire a shotgun shell, with the bottom of the pump directed at the target. A single shot close-range weapon.</item>
        <item>A CRKT Hissatsu tactical knife with a curved 7.125 inch blade, in a Kydex sheath.</item>
        <item>A Sig-Sauer P226 9mm pistol, in a cheap plastic shoulder holster. It has four rounds left in the magazine.</item>
        <item>A single TBG-7V thermobaric rocket for a russian RPG-7 launcher.</item>
        <item>A SOG Fasthawk tactical tomahawk, with a short 12" handle wrapped in parachute cord.</item>
        <item>A thermos filled with thermite and broken thermometers. The play on words is not lost upon you though a bad jolt could set the thing off.</item>
        <item>A cheap briefcase containing a worn Taurus 92B 9mm pistol and two empty extra magazines. There are three rounds in the gun\'s magazine.</item>
        <item>An oil-stained handkerchief wrapped around an old Ruger Security Six .38 revolver. The gun has a 4" barrel and is fully loaded.</item>
        <item>A baseball bat with a railroad spike driven through the end, which makes it resemble a medieval warhammer.</item>
        <item>A battered but still serviceable Browning Hi-Power 9mm, stamped with Rhodesian Light Infantry markings. A full 13 round magazine, loaded with FMJ ball ammunition, is inserted into the weapon.</item>
        <item>A steel and titanium ice-axe as used to climb glaciers and icy cliff-walls.</item>
        <item>An opened box of .45 handgun ammunition. It contains ten .45 rounds.</item>
        <item>An extremely small handgun, barely smaller than a derringer and easily concealable in the palm of the hand, that is chambered for a single .410 shotgun shell. Obviously useless beyond point-blank range, and also packing an absurd recoil due to its diminutive size.</item>
        <item>A sawn-off double-barreled 12 gauge shotgun from an indeterminate manufacturer. One of the barrels have been filled with lead, presumably to facilitate the gun\'s use as a club. The other barrel is loaded.</item>
        <item>A tied-up handkerchief containing nine 12 gauge shotgun shells.</item>
        <item>A disassembled and ammunition-less FN SCAR-H STD assault rifle (chambered for 7.62 NATO). The parts have been neatly laid out in an "exploded" schematic.</item>
        <item>A Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun with a missing shoulder stock.</item>
        <item>A Carl Gustav M1 with no ammo.</item>
        <item>Boobytrap: an old 1950 RCA television capacitor with a standard wall plug. The capacitor is fused to a mount that will seat on most doorknobs.

        <item>An aluminum bat, spray painted white, with the word "White Power" done in black paint on it. The bat has several dents and patches of blood or flesh. Testing the gore reveals someone had a sense of Irony, as the blood matches a White Southern Preacher, and suspected member of the KKK, who was found brutally beaten in the middle of nowhere. There are no suspects because the murder weapon was never found.</item>
        <item>A fifty round box of .38 ammunition.</item>
        <item>A 50-round factory box labeled Remington UMC 9mm 115gr FMJ but which actually contains odd lots of 9mm factory JHPs, a few PMC Starfires, some Winchester, some Gold Dot, and some Georgia Arms 147gr for a total of 28 rounds.</item>
        <item>2 M14 incendiary grenades.</item>
        <item>A prop 1921 Thompson SMG in a beat-up violin case.</item>

        <item>A Winchester Model 70 bolt-action rifle, chambered for .243 Winchester. This rifle was reported stolen from an El Paso, Texas gun store five years previously.</item>
        <item>A pair of fully automatic AK-74s, both weapons were used in the murder of 5 gang members and an undercover DEA agent. If the weapons are used and the bullets are recovered federal investigators will be on seen with in a few days.</item>
        <item>A Rubbermaid container with 60 assorted AK-74 magazines ranging from 20 rounds to 40 rounds. They are all loaded but some are not fully loaded. The number and type of each magazine is up to the game master.</item>
        <item>A Webley Mk. VI revolver in the old .455 British service caliber, very old and worn with a few small freckles of rust here and there, but mechanically sound. Box also contains several boxes of World War I vintage ammunition for it; at Keeper\'s discretion, the gun may occasionally misfire with this ammunition due to possible deterioration of the nearly century-old primers.</item>
        <item>A heavily customized Colt 1911 handgun. The most obvious modification is the handgrips, which have a stylized naked woman on them. The gun is not loaded.</item>
        <item>A custom-made folding knife with a four-inch, partially serrated kriss blade with a gladiator point. The blade is matte black, precision crafted ceramic, strong as folded steel but much lighter and sharper, invisible to metal detectors.</item>
        <item>4 Daewoo USAS-12 12-gauge selective-fire shotguns - with 2 clips and 1 drum each.</item>
        <item>A ziploc bag containing eight 7.62mm rifle rounds.</item>

        <item>A two foot long piece of iron pipe with skateboarders grip tape wound around one end.</item>
        <item>Resting on a crate is a Pelican foam-lined weapons case that contains a collection of handguns chambered for the 10mm round, These include a full-sized Glock 20 and a compact Model 29; a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 610 revolver with a 4-inch barrel; a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 1076 semi-auto pistol; an EAA Witness Elite Match semi-auto pistol; a Kimber Eclipse Custom II semi-automatic and a Colt Delta Elite. There are five spare magazines for each automatic and four preloaded speed loaders for the revolver. Inside the crate are boxes containing a total of 4000 rounds of 165-grain Speer Gold Dot 10mm hollowpoints.</item>
        <item>Footlocker: 3 S&amp;W 686 4" barrel .357 magnum revolvers, 3 Browning Hi-Powers (9mm w/ 9 magazines), 2 Mossburg 12 gauge shotguns (collapsible stock), 2 Colt Commando/AR-15s w/8-30 round magazines</item>
        <item>A styrofoam take-away box for chinese food containing a fully loaded Walther PPK 7.65mm (.32) pistol and a switchblade.</item>
        <item>A large garbage bag and a shopping cart filled with empty, crushed aluminum cans, like one would expect to see a homeless person pushing around. The garbage bag is filled with ratty, grimy clothing, and contains a note saying "FOR GOING DEEP UNDERCOVER."\nShould the investigators rummage through the cans, they\'ll find an H&amp;K MP7, two Makarov pistols, and a pistol-grip Mossberg shotgun, all loaded and wrapped in Wal-Mart bags to keep out the sticky soda-can sludge.</item>
        <item>A Stevens 311 .410-gauge double barreled shotgun. Comes with 5 20 round boxes of 000 buckshot.</item>
        <item>An opened box of .357 Magnum semi-jacketed hollowpoint bullets produced by Bitteroot Valley Ammunition of Montana. There are forty rounds left out of fifty.</item>
        <item>Case containing eight M67 hand grenades, Five have been painted pastel pink, the remaining three have been painted a fluorescent yellow.</item>
        <item>Some sort of bull-pup semi-to-full-automatic assault rifle, totally unlike anything even the most gun-fondling agent can recognise. There are no distinguishing marks, no logos, no serial-numbers on it - and all the workings appear to have been made specifically for this (unknown) make of gun. Considering its space-age qualities, it uses a 5-round 5.56mm stripper clip.</item>

        <item>A Ruger Vaquero revolver, chambered in .45 Long Colt, with a beautifully made leather holster and gun-belt made to look like that of an Old West gunfighter. The revolver itself is unloaded, but a total of thirty-six rounds have been slipped into the loops of the gun-belt.</item>

        <item>A SIG P-228 with four, 20 round magazines.</item>
        <item>A seemingly broken television set; however, closer inspection reveals the screen to have been removed and replaced, and if it is taken off (or shattered) it will be discovered that most of its internal parts have been removed to make room for a Mini-Uzi, three magazines, and a suppressor.</item>
        <item>A .45 Norinco M-1911A1C pistol with two shots remaining.</item>

        <item>A fiskars hatchet, worn from use but serviceable and sharp.</item>
        <item>A Taser X12 Less-Lethal shotgun. 12 Gauge, but modified so that it only accepts less-lethal rounds, such as beanbags and rubber bullets. The gun has four rails for mounting accessories. It is fully loaded (4+1 in the chamber) with specialized Taser rounds. An additional 5 Taser rounds are mounted on the side.</item>
        <item>Unloaded Beretta DT-10 shotgun.</item>

        <item>Two H&amp;K G3A3 battle rifles, with seven empty magazines and 200 rounds of surplus 7.62x51mm ammunition.

        <item>This footlocker contains four .303 caliber Short Magazine Lee Enfield rifles. Close examination reveals them to be rather crude-looking, with sloppy machine work, crooked stampings, poor finish on the metal and wood, etc.; an ARMORER skill roll reveals that these are "Khyber Pass" copies manufactured from assorted scrap metal by Pathan gunsmiths in what is now Pakistan, but they seem to be functional and safe to fire. Probably. No ammunition is present.</item>
        <item>A C-9 Hi-Point 9mm handgun with two magazines and a note with "LIFETIME WARRANTY" scribbled on it.</item>
        <item>A golf bag containing a small arsenal consisting of a 12-gauge Beretta UGB semi-automatic break-open shotgun with over-under barrels, a pair of Heckler &amp; Koch MK23 Mod 0 .45 caliber pistols and a pair of Armalite AR-24 9mm semi-automatic pistols.</item>

        <item>A Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P .40 caliber pistol ( use Glock 22 for stats ) with three fifteen round magazines, all loaded with HP ammo. A trace of the serial number reveals it was purchased by the Columbus, Ohio police department five years ago.</item>

        <item>Four M7 CS gas grenades.</item>
        <item>A powerful metal slingshot.</item>
        <item>Note on this container says "Militia Kit."

        <item>An Vietnam-era M60 machine gun and several belts of ammunition.</item>
        <item>An old wooden box holds two pistols (a H&amp;K USP and a Ruger MK II), two magazines and ammo for each, and matching silencers. The accompanying note says: "You cowboys love to take your brash Jewish girls to the Opera, but you should try a Fraulein or a red-blooded American gal sometime."

        <item>Four AK47 type rifles, very beat-up looking (those with appropriate skills may recognize them as the Yugoslav M72 variant), a bit scratched and rusty with crude Cyrillic carvings on the wooden buttstocks (linguists may note Bosnian Serb "CCCC" "Serb Solidarity" slogans, etc.). The rifles are full-auto military versions, and all serial numbers have been removed. There is also a satchel of five or six 30-round magazines for each rifle, and a few ammo cans containing a total of maybe 500 rounds of old Chinese copper-washed steel-case 7.62x39mm ammo--not quite enough to load all the mags. The rifles are filthy and could use a good cleaning and oiling but will work.</item>
        <item>A Ruger 22/45 .22LR target pistol mounted with a Primary Arms green dot sight, a Viridian green laser slight, threaded barrel and a Gemtech Alpine suppressor. Comes with 4 (empty) 10-round magazines.</item>

        <item>A large-ish and rather heavy box from amazon.com. Opening the box reveals a half-dozen boxes of 9mm ammunition. Opening each of those boxes reveals that the boxes are actually mislabeled; rather than containing standard parabellum ammo, they\'re actually full of hollowpoints.</item>

        <item>A fully loaded Glock 17 9mm pistol. It has been painted pink.</item>

        <item>Improvised unguided small rockets, made by combining commercially available model rockets and filling the nose-cone elements with home-made flash powder wired to an impact detonator.

        <item>A Citadel LE Tactical 12-gauge pump action shotgun.</item>
        <item>What appears to be a standard issue US Military M4A1 Carbine (With Safe, Semi, Auto fire selectors), and an ACOG scope mounted to the rails. The shell of the weapon is done in an almost cartoonishly bright desert camo pattern, which matches none used by any military. "This machine kills terrorists" has been clumsily scratched, as if with a knife, into the stock. The magazine for the weapon is empty, but there is a bullet in the chamber.</item>
        <item>.338 Lapua Surgeon rifle customized by GA Precision.</item>
        <item>Hand lapped and trued action, 27 inch Krieger heavy fluted barrel, Jewell trigger, McMillan stock, 3-20x50 Schmidt and Bender rifle scope mounted on a pair of Badger Ordnance rings.</item>

        <item>An SKS carbine with sling and chest pouch containing 10, 10 round stripper clips loaded with FMJ ammunition. There are no importation marks and the serial number is untraceable, indicating it was not imported legally. It appears to have been made in 1952 in the USSR.</item>
        <item>Five 50-round boxes of .22 LR subsonic 38-grain lead hollowpoint bullets from Fiocchi Shooting Dynamics</item>
        <item>An Enfield No.2 snubnosed .38 S&amp;W revolver.</item>

        <item>An Israeli \'Hush Puppy\'. A modified Ruger 10/22 with integrated silencer. Short and light, it can be fired with little more sound than the firing pin striking the round.</item>

        <item>A tomahawk of modern design. It has a fairly short wooden handle a spike on the reverse side of the head, and a leather sheath. A successful roll of an appropriate skill might reveal that it appears to be a genuine Peter LaGana "Vietnam Tomahawk."</item>
        <item>Customized Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 .38 Special revolver with a heavy barrel, action job, hard chrome finish, and a Tasco Pro-Point sight.</item>
        <item>A Beretta 92FS pistol. Attached to the trigger guard is a note reading "Magazine = bomb. Trigger = detonator. Have fun."\nTrue to form, the pistol is booby trapped to explode when the trigger is pulled.</item>

        <item>4 Glock 21 .45 ACP pistols (strangely, these have no serial numbers - they were not filed off - they are just not on the guns at all; pointing to the fact that they are very good copies or have been manufactured illegally) There are 10 13-round magazines for these.</item>
        <item>A Bersa FS22M .22 pistol with a silencer. The magazine contains four shots.</item>

        <item>A small note in the box reads "Don\'t be an ass! When you\'re done clean the weapon, put the weapon back, replace the ammo, and replace the bottle of scotch! This weapon has served many well. Treat her with respect, and it will be there to save your ass when the shit hits the fan. Good hunting and watch your back!"</item>
        <item>Six Glock 22 .40-caliber pistols, twelve fully-loaded magazines, and a half-dozen shoulder holsters, all contained in fresh butcher paper and hastily wrapped in white electrical tape.

        <item>1 large Zippo-type lighter. It is actually an assassination weapon. When opened and squeezed in proper way it fires one .22LR bullet coated with cyanide. It needs to be fired at point blank to hit.</item>
        <item>A fully loaded 9mm Glock 19 pistol, in a leather belt holster.</item>

        <item>A 33-round magazine for a Glock 18 machine pistol. It also fits a Glock 17, 19, 26 or 34 ( all 9mm Glock pistols ). It is loaded with 9mm FMJ ammunition. Concealing a pistol using this magazine would be laughable.</item>
        <item>A folding entrenching tool ("E-tool") that has been sharpened to a razor edge.</item>
        <item>A submachine gun that resembles a scaled-down M3 \'Grease Gun\'. It is chambered for .22LR and packed inside a foam-lined carrying case along with three 30-round stick magazines. The SMG is obviously a custom job, and features no serial numbers or manufacturer\'s marks.</item>

        <item>An entire crate of M72 Light Anti-Armor Weapons, whose packaging seem to imply they were shipped to the Israeli Defense Forces during the Yom Kippur War in \'73.\nHowever, this crate was withheld from final shipment, because it contains training units. Their rocket will fire as usual, but when it hits, it produces a cloud of light-blue powdered chalk rather than an explosion. There is no external indication that these are training units, unfortunately, and odds are the only way the investigators will find out is through trial and error.</item>

        <item>A Bren light machine gun. This particular weapon is of the L4 variety, which was modified after WWII to fire 7.62x51mm rounds. Its condition is singularly miserable: the connection between the stock and receiver has become loose, and most of the rifle is coated in rust (with malfunction stats reflective of this decay, perhaps MALF 70 would be accurate).\nShould serial numbers be run, it comes up as being used by Irish forces during peacekeeping missions during the Congo Crisis of the 1960s. Judging by the amount of corrosion, it can be inferred that the weapon must have stayed there without care for years before Delta Green (somehow) obtained it.</item>
        <item>This footlocker contains six identical blue pasteboard boxes, each containing a new S&amp;W Model 10 revolver in .38 Special. All six are marked with identical serial numbers.

        <item>An AKS-74u with a worn-down wooden foregrip and scratch marks all over the metal parts\' finishes. Etched into the left side of the receiver is, in Russian, "THIS MACHINE KILLS TRAITORS". The actual term used is \'suki\', which is a massively derogatory Russian criminal term for police informants which, translated, means \'bitches\', though that translation loses a good part of the stigma.</item>

        <item>A box of twenty .357 Magnum rounds.</item>

        <item>Two SIG SG550 assault rifles, as used by the Swiss armed forces. A check of their serial numbers indicate they were listed as converted to semi-automatic only and sold to retiring Swiss soldiers; the two problems with that are, of course, that these are capable of fully automatic fire, and are nowhere near Switzerland.</item>
        <item>A plain cardboard box that has a warning label, "Caution! Live Turkeys!". The box has no air holes, and doesn\'t smell of fowl, and also isn\'t large enough to hold more than one turkey.\nIf opened, the box is filled with styrofoam packing peanuts, a fully loaded US Government model FN P90 with reflex sight and sling, and two spare magazines.

        <item>A pair of brass knuckles with spikes crudely attached.</item>
        <item>A 14"x10"x4" highly polished rosewood box with the word "Daddy" picked out on the lid in cubic zirconium. Inside is a platinum plated .50AE Desert Eagle with mother-of-pearl grips. The trigger, hammer, safety catch and slide release are gold plated, and the letter \'D\' is inlaid in gold on the grips. The pistol is unloaded but eight, highly polished, rounds of .50 Action Express are included in the box. Incidentally the box is lined with day-glo pink crushed velvet.</item>
        <item>Stoeger Cougar .45 semi-automatic. 3 empty eight-round clips, two unopened boxes of .45 ACP bullets.</item>
        <item>An M-16. This is not the Armalite assault rifle, though; this is an "M-16" described by Che Guevara in his book \'Guerrilla Warfare\'. It is a 16-gauge sawed-off shotgun converted into an improvised mortar by attaching a stand to its muzzle, and its ammunition is in the form of Molotov cocktails whose neck has been sealed with a wooden dowel rod that fits into the shotgun\'s barrel. Upon firing a blank from the shotgun, the force propels the Molotov up to 100 yards away, much like a rifle grenade.</item>
        <item>An Emerson CQB-7 tactical folding knife.</item>
        <item>A loaded C2 Taser Stun Gun.</item>
        <item>A shoebox full of M67 frag grenades. Anyone with military knowledge will recognize that the light blue stripe on them indicates they are inert, for training purposes only. An all-civilian party, however, may not.</item>
        <item>An Kimel AP-9 9mm pistol that comes with 4 spare 20-round magazines.</item>
        <item>An M224 60mm mortar, as issued at the company level by the US Army and Marine Corps.\nOf course, its usefulness is somewhat hampered by the lack of mortar rounds.</item>
        <item>Inside a rifle case is a Knight\'s Armament SR-25 with suppressor, bipod and a rifle scope. There are two 20 round magazines loaded with match grade rounds.</item>
        <item>A 9mm Luger P-08 pistol with three rounds in the clip. A crude three-barred cross has been carved into the handle. A check of the manufacturing number reveals it was made in 1941.</item>
        <item>A rusty Chinese Type 56 Carbine with half the stock ripped out by something with very large teeth.</item>
        <item>An olive-drab Czechoslovakian Army gas suit balled up and crammed into a large messenger bag; at the center of the wad is a busted gas mask and a Micro-Uzi, fully loaded along with a single spare magazine.</item>

        <item>A longslide 1911 with an elaborate laser-sight attached by a special mount to the top. The sight looks like it was surely space-age technology in the 80s, but is now outdated and cumbersome, especially given it\'s palm sized activation switch at the end of a long wire. The sight and gun both work however. One full 8 round magazine is loaded, and 2 more full ones are nearby. The sight has 20 minutes of sustained charge in it\'s battery.</item>
        <item>A beat up old M79 grenade launcher with various marks and carvings etched onto it. The sliding tab used for adjusting for elevation on the sight is missing.</item>
        <item>A plastic carry-case containing a Mossberg 500 Home Security shotgun (chambered for the puny .410 bore cartridge, 1d6+2 damage), a large shotgun silencer (reduces Listen rolls to hear by 25%) and 50 cartridges.</item>
        <item>A locker containing two M-14 battle rifles, chambered in 7.62x51 NATO. The rifles both look considerably worn, and are beginning to develop some rust, but they will still function quite well. A trace of the serial numbers reveals that these guns were part of a shipment of arms that was meant to go to the South Vietnamese army.</item>

        <item>A 50-round box of Winchester Ranger .40 155gr (RA40155HP) with 44 rounds left.</item>
        <item>A sawn off shotgun. This is particular type is the infamous Lupara. Has the name "Giovanni Antonelli" inscribed in silver on the stock.</item>
        <item>At first glance this resembles pieces of pipe assembled in such a manner as to suggest a heavy, bulky handgun. A successful ARMORER roll will tell the PC that this is a "Welrod" silenced pistol from the Second World War, and in working order. It is in caliber .32 ACP, with a seven-round detachable box magazine housed in the grip frame. It is a manually-operated bolt-action, requiring the user to manually operate a handle to extract and eject the fired casing, load a fresh cartridge, and cock the mechanism. It is large, heavy, bulky, and difficult to conceal, but very quiet indeed when fired. No ammunition nor spare magazines are present.</item>
        <item>A long, matte-black case. Inside is a lovingly maintained .55 caliber Mk. II Boys Anti-Tank Rifle from WWII. The weapon has a fully loaded (5 shot) magazine. It has sufficient force to penetrate the armor of light WW2 tanks, but lacks the power to penetrate modern armored vehicles.</item>
        <item>One large gasoline powered chainsaw with a very long blade. Someone appears to have modified the engine for increased power output as two large exhaust pipes exit the motor to the rear.</item>
        <item>Dagger, Double edged 12" long, low steel</item>
        <item>A replica produced STG-44 assault rifle. While it looks close to the original, this is a recently produced model for civilian use. It chambers .22 LR ammunition, and can only fire semi-automatic. It has two magazines and a box of 100 .22 LR rounds.</item>
        <item>One Sig Sauer "Mosquito" .22 caliber pistol. Comes with three extra ten-round magazines. Jams often.</item>
        <item>An IMI Mini-Uzi with six 32 round magazines of 9x19mm rounds. The barrel has a silencer threaded onto it, and another silencer next to it. The ammunition is somewhat unusual: the slugs are copper jacketed with nickel-iron-manganese alloy cores.</item>
        <item>A leather shoulder-holster containing a fully loaded (7 rounds) Taurus Model 627 Tracker .357 Magnum revolver with a 4" barrel. The titanium frame has small pits in it as if something horribly acidic has spattered it.</item>
        <item>A crate containing a WW2 era MG34 general-purpose machine gun that requires some cleaning. It has a bipod and two barrels included with it. Along with two 250 round belts of 7.92x57mm Mauser.</item>
        <item>A well-worn but maintained Mosin-Nagant M91/30 rifle, with fixed bayonet and classic green canvas sling, along with one hundred rounds of ammunition in stripper clips. The right side of the stock bears a painstakingly etched carving of a scorpion, its stinger raised and ready to strike.</item>
        <item>A small case holding two FN Five-SeveN 5.7mm pistols. The first pistol is a civilian version for restricted markets, which only holds 10 rounds and uses normal 5.7mm ammunition. The serial number shows that it was owned by a Gun Store near or in the town where the Green Box is located that closed down six months ago, and the owner moved away.\nThe second pistol has a 20-round magazine, attached suppressor and LAM, and is loaded with the Armor Piercing ammunition only sold to military or law enforcement. It shows no sign of a serial number.</item>
        <item>A soft carrying case holds a Savage Model 111 bolt-action rifle chambered in 7mm Remington Magnum, mounted with a Simmons 3-9x40 scope. Four pre-loaded detachable 3-round box magazines are also stashed in the case.</item>

        <item>A heavily customised Browning Hi-Power Mk. III 9mm pistol, with a Commander-style hammer, extended ambidextrous safety, extended slide release, and wide combat trigger installed by Cylinder &amp; Slide, Inc. of Fremont, NE. The magazine disconnect has been removed, the trigger pull lightened to five pounds, and a set of Novak combat night sights installed. The pistol has also been given a graphite black Cerakote finish and a permanent Slipstream lubrication treatment by Crusader Weaponry of Murray UT, and a set of gray G10 pistol grips from MilTac. It is contained in a brushed-aluminum case along with four loaded 15-round high capacity flush fit magazines from Mec-Gar of Italy, a cordura quad mag pouch for carrying the magazines and three different holsters: shoulder, hip and inside-the-waistband.

        <item>Some scattered gunsmithing tools surrounding six Tec-9 pistols; closer examination indicates an amateur attempted to convert them from semi-automatic to fully automatic. Five of the six have been ruined beyond repair, but the sixth was close enough that a single Armorer, Gunsmith, or halved Mechanical Repair skill roll can finish it out into a working (though questionably reliable) machine pistol</item>
        <item>One 9x18mm Makarov pistol, 2 loaded 8 round magazines and a cleaning rod all contained in a well worn brown leather flap holster.</item>
        <item>A 20-round box of Winchester 10mm 175gr Silvertips, containing 15 Silvertips and 3 of what appear to be 180gr Double Tap jacketed hollowpoints.</item>
        <item>A SPAS-12 shotgun, there bag of 12 gauge shells laying next to it. How many is up to the GM.</item>
        <item>2 Beretta 90-Two 9mm pistols with Gemtech Trinity suppressors and 6 15-round magazines.</item>
        <item>Three "Bucket o\' Bullets" full to the brim with .22 Long Rifle rounds. A fourth bucket is half-full of 22 LR #12 shot cartridges (so-called "rat-shot")</item>

        <item>A surgical scalpel, its handle covered in rubber bands.</item>

        <item>One nylon gym bag containing a Beretta M9 pistol with barrel fitted for a quick detachable silencer, one silencer, five 15 round magazines loaded with subsonic 9mm ammunition and a cheap, black, nylon shoulder holster. The pistol is stamped US GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. Silencer is wet type: liquid must be poured through the silencer to ensure effective use.</item>
        <item>Rolled in a carpet is a USMC-issue 83.5mm Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) with three rockets. Deafeningly loud, it can collapse a building or destroy a tank in one shot. This one was "liberated" with five rockets from Fort Lauderdale, Fl. by a disgruntled US Marine in 1998 and subsequently sold on the black market.</item>
        <item>A Savage 775A 12-gauge semi-automatic shotgun; the aluminum-alloy receiver is engraved with three ducks in flight on the left side and a pair of pheasants on the right side.</item>
        <item>A plastic box containing an old BLU-43/B "Dragontooth" air-droppable land mine, as used in large numbers by the US in Vietnam. This tiny (3" long) mine was intended to maim rather than kill and is quite unstable by now. Any Agent moving it may well join the many Vietnamese soldiers and peasants needing a replacement limb.</item>

        <item>A vintage German anti-tank magnetic mine, of the type used in the opening years of WWII before man portable rockets were invented. Its use would have required the near-suicidal act of running up to a tank and slapping it onto the armor, though it would have practically guaranteed a kill.\nIt is still definitely a powerful shaped charge, but its age may cause it to malfunction at the Keeper\'s discretion.</item>
        <item>A Dan Wesson .41 Magnum revolver with a 6 inch vent rib heavy barrel and a barrel-mounted scope mount with a removable Millett 2X20 scope. Someone has thoughtfully included a 50-round box of 210-grain .41 Magnum jacketed hollowpoints manufactured by Bitteroot Valley Ammunition.</item>
        <item>Three atlatls (spear throwers) made of bone and bundled together by a rubber band. They each have catalog markings from Chicago\'s Field Museum of Natural History; they were part of a large collection of Native American artifacts that went missing from a storeroom in 1981.</item>
        <item>Three switchblade knives sitting on a shelf. One has had the spring removed, so the blade is fixed open.</item>
        <item>A full 20-round box of Cor-Bon 10mm 200gr FMJ "Penetrators".</item>
        <item>Half a dozen lead-filled custom-made leather saps, ranging in length from 6.5 inches to 14 inches and in weight from 8oz. to 16oz.</item>
        <item>A plastic bag containing seven non-lethal "Bean Bag" rounds for a 12 gauge shotgun.</item>
        <item>A fully loaded Star Model 30 9mm pistol. The gun is quite worn and the risk of malfunction is increased by 2%,</item>
        <item>A Micro-UZI 9mm submachinegun, with eight rounds in the magazine.</item>
        <item>A Charter Arms Off Duty .38 Special revolver in a plastic bag. This gun was the murder weapon in the case of a slain local college student a few years ago. The case is still open.</item>
        <item>A needle-sharp ice-pick, its tip covered with a piece of cork. The wooden handle is worn smooth from long use.</item>
        <item>A small single-gun safe. Inside is an STI Duty CT 1911 .45-caliber pistol with a 4.15 inch slide and an extended, threaded barrel, and a pancake holoster. A small pouch contains an Advanced Armaments Evolution suppressor. Three spare magazines loaded up with TTI 250-grain hollowpoints are included in another belt pouch.</item>
        <item>One red and three green flares for a flare gun.</item>
        <item>A black plastic box containing a fully loaded (14 rounds) Smith&amp;Wesson Model 459 9mm pistol and two (empty) extra magazines.</item>
        <item>A small workbench has a complex hand-cranked tool bolted to its top. A successful ARMORER roll reveals that it is a reloading press, for reusing fired centerfire cartridge cases to load ammunition, along with appropriate dies, etc., for several popular handgun and rifle, but not shotgun, calibers, and several yellowed, dog-eared manuals of loading data, full of brief scribbled notes and highlighted portions. Also present are cartons of primers and canisters of various types of smokeless powder suitable for reloading a wide range of handgun, shotgun, or rifle cartridges. No cases or bullets are present, though.</item>
        <item>Three plastic cases, each containing a Springfield xD9 in good condition, three 12 round magazines, a suppressor with no markings, and 36 rounds of subsonic FMJ 9mm ammunition. A large sheet of green printer paper taped to the top case reads "For use in populated areas. Ammo pre-treated to defeat NIBIN/IBIS ID".</item>
        <item>A foldable straight razor.</item>
        <item>A Mark III SMLE which has been sawed off down to the magazine, something common in WWI trench warfare. The rifle is empty, but a box of 20 .303 rounds is found nearby</item>
        <item>A box containing ten 308 Win. rounds.</item>
        <item>4 Glock 21 .45 ACP self-load pistols (no serial numbers there at all) with 5 13-round magazines for these.</item>
        <item>An Indonesian Parang machete with a razor-sharp 1.2 foot blade. The handle is made from reddish wood and carved into the shape of a leaping tiger. There is also a wooden scabbard made from the same wood. Down the side of the scabbard is written in Bahasa Indonesia : "Travel Light. Strike Hard.".</item>
        <item>In a weapons case is a Heckler &amp; Koch HK416: D10RS. It is fitted with an ACOG scope, a fore grip, and a spring loaded back up iron sight. There are no magazines or ammo; the players will need to find some.</item>
        <item>A Calico M960A 9mm submachine gun stashed inside a canvas sack along with four 50-round helical magazines.</item>
        <item>A set of four M3 carbines, of 1960\'s vintage. Ten thirty round magazines are included, along with the original (very dated) infrared night vision scopes and mounting equipment. They are also integrally suppressed (also dated). Other, more modern infrared scopes could also be used with them.</item>
        <item>A fully loaded (10 rounds) Glock 26 "subcompact" 9mm pistol, with a rubber ankle-holster.</item>
        <item>An imitation broadsword.</item>
        <item>This narrow seven-foot-long crate contains a massively heavy "antimateriel rifle" of the sort wealthy enthusiasts or lavishly equipped armies might purchase in .50 BMG, but this one is bigger yet. It is a single-shot bolt-action in 14.5mm Soviet, weighing over 20kg and longer than a man is tall. No serial number or other markings are present on it, though it is obviously used, and lovingly maintained. It has been equipped with a very expensive European target scope, for which Keepers may award appropriate modifiers. No ammunition for it is present, however, and Wal-Mart doesn\'t stock this caliber.</item>
        <item>Contained in a drag bag is a Mauser SP66 precision sniper rifle. The weapon has been rechambered from the original 7.62 x 51mm NATO caliber cartridge to .300 Winchester Magnum and is fitted with a Bausch &amp; Lomb 6-24 power variable magnification telescopic sight.</item>
        <item>An opened paper box containing thirty-two 10mm rounds.</item>
        <item>A green gym bag containing:\n- A Charter Arms Mag Pug .357 Magnum revolver.\n- A compact Bersa BP9CC 9mm pistol with two spare magazines\n- A Bulgarian-made Arcus 98 9mm pistol with two spare magazines\n- A sawed off 20-gauge over/under shotgun\n- A FAMAE Mini-SAF 9mm compact submachine gun with two spare magazines\n- 4 50-round boxes of 9mm FMJ\n- 1 25-round box of Rio Royal 20-gauge 00 buckshot shells\n- 1 50-round box of 125-grain .357 Magnum hollowpoints\n- four white plastic full-face masks with eye and mouth holes;</item>
        <item>400 rounds of 9mm 158 grain FMJ subsonic ammunition, manufactured by Fiocchi.</item>
        <item>A modern hunting crossbow made by Barnett International. There are eight bolts with the weapon, so ammo shouldn\'t be an immediate concern.</item>
        <item>Hidden among a box of Christmas lights is a pair of Makarov PB with integral suppressors. Each weapon is loaded but there are no extra magazines.</item>
        <item>A collection of exotic 40mm grenade rounds, such ass canister-shot and flechette, tear gas, parachute-flare, and a singular mysterious round bearing only sizable yellow biohazard symbols on its casing. Keeper\'s discretion as to what it actually contains.</item>
        <item>A small folding case about the size of a deck of cards made out of cheap nylon fabric and velcro. Opening the packet reveals five steel playing cards with hand-sharpened edges, ostensibly for throwing (20% penalty to attempts to actually use them because they\'re not practical weapons). Together, the cards make up a full house in poker.</item>
        <item>A Kimber TLE-2, stainless steel, .45 ACP pistol with three loaded, 8-round Wilson Combat magazines (also stainless steel). The pistol is heavily engraved with floral designs and images with a Western motif (steer skulls, cacti, etc.). It has ivory (or faux ivory) grips laser engraved with the image of a star in a circle, similar to a Texas Ranger badge. The pistol is accompanied by a brown leather gunbelt with an attached holster and double magazine pouch. The belt, holster and magazine pouch are heavily carved with a floral pattern that matches the pattern on the pistol. "E. Calvera - Maker" is stamped on the inside lining of the gunbelt.</item>
        <item>12-gauge Browning BPS pump-action shotgun with a 28-inch barrel.</item>
        <item>A 16-gauge Fox/Sterlingworth double-barrelled shotgun in a carrying case along with three 10-round boxes of HEVI-Shot No.4 16-gauge shells.</item>
        <item>A Norinco Type 85 with integral suppressor and 10 loaded magazines.</item>
        <item>A Fireman\'s axe. Spray-painted black.</item>
        <item>A zippered carry case containing a modern replica of a bolt-action Springfield 1903-A4 .30-06 sniper rifle, manufactured by Gibbs Rifle Company complete with an authentic replica M84 2.2x riflescope and mounts and replica M1907 leather sling.</item>
        <item>A tied-up handkerchief containing eight 9mm rounds, three .45 rounds and a single .44 Magnum round.</item>
        <item>Glock 37 .45 GAP pistol with attached 150 lumen tactical LED light, three loaded 10 round magazines (FMJ ammo), a thigh holster in a black gym bag.</item>
        <item>A rusty Remington Rand M1911A1 .45 automatic pistol with a fully loaded clip. Works, but with a doubled chance of a misfire.</item>
        <item>A three foot long shovel with an ash wood handle and steel fittings and blade. The blade is sharpened to a fine edge and is stained with dried blood. An analysis of the blood shows that it does not match that of any known creature.</item>
        <item>A loaded sawed-off double-barrelled 12 gauge shotgun.</item>
        <item>A brand new SRM Arms M1216 12-gauge semi-automatic shotgun, with two 16 round rotary quad-tube detachable magazines, which can be loaded with either 2 3/4- or 3-inch shells. The amidextrous receiver and controls can be set up for either right or left handed shooters. It also has Picatinny rails for mounting optics and accessories.</item>
        <item>An M1 Garand rifle. Carved into the stock is a swastika and twenty tally marks.</item>
        <item>A well-worn Glock 17 9mm pistol in a plastic shoulder-holster. The gun is fully loaded and in a pouch on the shoulder-rig two additional (loaded) magazines can be found.</item>
        <item>An antique Martini-Henry rifle, chambered in the .577/450 black powder cartridge. A few dozen such cartridges sit next to it in a moth-eaten burlap bag labelled " Property of the Belgian Ministry of Colonies" in French.\nThe weapon is in fairly decent shape for a weapon of its age, and could probably fetch a few thousand dollars at auction.</item>
        <item>A sledgehammer, covered with dust. Unknown, dried green liquid on the edge.</item>
        <item>A plastic trash can with rags on top. Under the rags are seven Makarov PM pistols. There are magazines present for the weapons but there are only 20 rounds present.</item>
        <item>Three well used Republiek van Suid-Afrika Vektor SS-77 machine guns with bipods and six belts of (200) 7.62x51mm NATO rounds each.</item>
        <item>This heavy olive-drab steel ammo can is about three quarters full of loose .22 LR cartridges--it contains three or four thousand rounds at least. Oddly, the cases have no headstamps, and anyone with the ARMORER skill will notice they\'re a little odd looking. When examined closely by someone with the ARMORER skill, it is revealed that the ammunition is loaded with full metal jacket bullets rather than the normal pure soft lead bullets, rather unusual for commercially made .22 LR. An ARMORER skill roll will suggest that it was probably made this way for some military black-ops unit for use in suppressed weapons in combat, to comply with the Hague Convention laws of war. For game purposes there is no difference between this ammunition and any other, except that the lack of a manufacturer\'s code or logo on the headstamp will make it rather more difficult for anyone finding the casings to trace where they came from, which is why they are unmarked.</item>
        <item>2 Remington 870 12 gauge pump shotguns with 20" rifled deer slug barrels.</item>
        <item>A munitions crate containing a dozen heavily used STEN Mk V 9mm submachineguns, along with three 32-round magazines for each. A relevant roll will determine the set as being of Israeli provenance.\nAn Armorer roll will reveal that the weapons are all in terrible condition. All of the guns will fail to fire for a variety of reasons if used, and most of the magazines\' springs have rusted into immobility. The guns can be used for parts to cobble together perhaps 2 or 3 functioning weapons.\nAs a side note, STEN guns have a reputation for accidental discharge, which age would do no favors for. These weapons can, at the Keeper\'s discretion, go off when jostled, dropped, or if it would generally be incredibly inconvenient for the players - additional fun potential in deciding what the unintended fire hits!</item>
        <item>An ex-Argentine Navy Mathogo ATGM launcher with a single rocket. The rocket is in poor condition, and it is the Keeper\'s discretion whether it works at all.</item>
        <item>A fully loaded (twenty rounds) czech Skorpion Vz. 61 E .32 submachinegun, with a plastic shoulder holster. On the opposite side of the holster harness hangs another loaded twenty round magazine.</item>
        <item>A Carl Gustav M/45 9mm submachine gun. It is quite worn and has a small ivory Buddha statuette hanging from the barrel by a leather thong. One full 30-round magazine is inserted in the gun.</item>
        <item>4 unopened boxes (25 rounds each) of Hornady "Zombie Max" 115-grain 9mm ammuntion and 2 unopened boxes (25 rounds each) of Hornady "Zombie Max" 165-grain .40 S&amp;W ammunition.</item>

        <item>A heavy butcher\'s cleaver. The blade is pitted with rust and stains.</item>
        <item>A silenced .22 Browning Buckmark target pistol with a full 10 shot magazine inserted.</item>
        <item>A fully loaded .38 Smith&amp;Wesson Model 36 snub-nosed revolver, with a leather belt holster.</item>
        <item>A German MP40 submachinegun from World War II, with six spare magazines. It appears almost new.</item>
        <item>10 1 lb. cans of black powder.</item>
        <item>A Ruger 10/22 rifle with a crude homemade suppressor, consisting of an automotive oil filter soldered onto the barrel. To compensate for the added length, the stock has been sawed off and replaced with a cheap sliding-wire design, as seen on sub-machine guns like the MAT-49.</item>
        <item>A small metal carrying case, which inside contains a .308 Upper for an AR-15 or similar model weapon, and the tools required to install it.</item>
        <item>A single Soviet F1 hand grenade.</item>
        <item>A one-shot M72 LAW disposable light anti-armour weapon. It has been armed but not fired.</item>

        <item>Smoke Grenades\nAlong with mini-flares, these can be used to mark out a landing zone, as well as provide concealment for an escape or disruption for an assault.</item>
        <item>Three .40 S&amp;W caliber Glock 23 pistols. The serial numbers have removed. The pistols sit beside a box of .40 caliber S&amp;W ammunition.</item>
        <item>A well worn copy of the King James Bible, there\'s a silver Celtic cross on a steel chain wrapped around it. The bible has been hollowed out and now holds a S&amp;W 627 revolver loaded with 357 magnum hollow points.</item>
        <item>An aluminum Zero Halliburton briefcase. Nestled inside are a pair of Dan Wesson RZ-10 ten-millimeter semi-automatic pistols and in between them rests a customized Glock 19 converted to .22LR with a threaded barrel. Gemtech silencer and a box of subsonic ammunition. There are extra magazines and concealment holsters for each weapon.</item>

        <item>A painstakingly-recreated example of John Kelly\'s handgun from Tom Clancy\'s "Without Remorse". It is a Government model M1911A1, which has had its internals swapped to fire .22LR using a commercial conversion kit. Attached to the barrel is a homemade but still effective suppressor, and over its ejection port a handmade brass catcher has been installed to collect the spent cartridges.</item>
        <item>A very worn, but well maintained M3 "Grease Gun" SMG in .45 caliber, with a silencer and about a dozen spare 30-round magazines. All serial numbers have been removed. A partial box of .45 ammo is present, enough to load a single mag with two or three cartridges left over.</item>
        <item>An ugly, crude-looking submachinegun that appears to be made of steel tubing and sheet metal, with several spare magazines. An ARMORER roll will identify it correctly as a World War II-era "Sten Gun," designed in the UK for simplicity of manufacture. Weapons like this one were once made by the thousands in clandestine workshops in occupied Europe. And this one looks rather new, come to think of it... which might explain the files and chisels in the toolbox with it. The gun has a threaded muzzle and the box also contains an equally crudely made silencer that fits the threads, and a few boxes of subsonic 9mm ammo. Note that this is an open-bolt, straight-blowback SMG and though the silencer is effective at slowing the release of propellant gases and muffling the sounds of individual gunshots, the normal operation of the gun will still make a very loud mechanical clattering sound when fired with the silencer attached.</item>
        <item>A trunk with three AK-103\'s, 45 magazines and four 200 round ammunition boxes.</item>
        <item>A Vietnam-era M79 40mm grenade launcher. It is not loaded.</item>

        <item>Old military rifle. Bolt action rifle chambered in 7.62x54mmR. Magazine holds 5 rounds, and is loaded. 2 spare, loaded stripper clips lie next to it. The gun is well worn and smells slightly of cosmoline.</item>
        <item>A KelTec PLR16 5.56mm semi-auto pistol, equipped with a short folding stock, Battlecomp muzzle brake to reduce muzzle climb, a Midwest Industries forend, a Magpul AFG (angled foregrip) a Primary Arms micro green dot reflex sight, and a Viridian X5L green laser sight/taclight combo.

        <item>A 12 gauge Escort MarineGuard pump-action shotgun with 5-shot magazine capacity, an 18-inch barrel and nickel finish, inside a soft shotgun case.</item>
        <item>Six shells which could be classified as either gigantic bullets or tiny artillery shells by a layman; someone with a military background will recognize them as 25mm rounds from a naval autocannon. The yellow-painted tips indicate them to be MK210 High Explosive Incendiary Tracers.</item>
        <item>A heavy machete with soot blackened blade and a well-worn wooden grip. There are three notches carved into the grip.</item>
        <item>A Ruger Mini-14.</item>
        <item>A rusted trench knife, stamped \'U.S 1918". The name \'Laura\' is scratched into the opposite side of the handle.</item>

        <item>A Serbu Super Shorty 12-gauge custom compact. stockless short shotgun with a spring-loaded folding forestock, built from a Mossberg Maverick 88. There is also a black nylon ambidextrous thigh holster for the shotgun, with a partial break-front which holds the forward grip folded and loops on the outside that can hold three extra shells.</item>
        <item>A metal footlocker, containing several boxes of .40 S&amp;W ammo, totaling to about 1000 rounds.\nA Post-it note, in a woman\'s handwriting, is stuck to the inside lid of the footlocker. It reads:\nPlease keep restocked if able. We go through a lot of these around here.\n-- SANDRA</item>
        <item>A coffee can filled with assorted pistol rounds. It is mostly made up of 9mm rounds but intermixed are .45 caliber, .357 magnum and .38 special rounds.</item>
        <item>A sniper drag bag. Inside is a McMillan M88 PIP .50 BMG bolt-action sniper rifle with a 4-16x Horus Falcon steel tactical scope mounted on it. The five-round magazine is empty, but a plastic ammo box holding ten rounds of 619-grain M20 APIT (Armor Piercing Incendiary/Tracer) is taped to the buttstock and another is inside one of the bag\'s side pouches.</item>
        <item>A Guard Dog Security Cell Phone Stun Gun, a 2,700,000 volt stun gun made up to look like an innocent cell phone.</item>
        <item>An original production run M1921 Thompson SMG in a canvas bag, with a sling, and two drum magazines, one loaded one empty. The weapon is well maintained, except for three tally marks carved into the stock.</item>
        <item>A .357 revolver with three rounds left in the cylinder. This weapon was involved in a police shooting in Texas, so obviously having your finger prints on this gun would be a very bad idea. It can be used to frame someone as the suspect in question was never caught or identified.</item>
        <item>This soft cloth gun case contains a Winchester Model 1894 lever-action hunting rifle in .30-30 caliber, clean and well maintained, with target-type peep sights but no scope. There is also a leather bandoleer with loops to hold up to forty cartridges, but only fourteen are present. They are loaded with soft-nose hunting bullets.</item>
        <item>A folding knife with a serrated 4-inch blade - it is a cheap knockoff of a Spyderco Civilian.</item>
        <item>An M4A1 carbine with eight rounds remaining in the magazine. No extra ammunition or clips. The serial number is still persent and if traced will show it was reported as missing from Vandenberg Air Force Base.</item>
        <item>A Mossberg 500 shotgun, with a worn leather bandolier containing 15-20 shells.</item>
        <item>An unloaded Russian RPG-7 rocket propelled grenade launcher.</item>

        <item>A fully loaded .357 Magnum Taurus Model 65 revolver with 4" barrel. The gun is quite worn and the serial numbers have been filed off.</item>
        <item>A case for an electric key board inside is a Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle and a homemade suppressor. The suppressor is nearly as long as the rifle making it an unwieldy setup. There is no ammo present.</item>
        <item>A one-shot veterinarian\'s tranquilizer pistol and four tranquilizer darts. The darts are strong enough to put a large animal like a bear or lion to sleep in a minute or two, and are quite likely to be lethal for an old or weak human.</item>
        <item>An empty 9mm Glock 17 pistol with an attached post-it note saying "Emergency use only! Ballistics will match Arizona cop-killing!".</item>
        <item>A shoebox containing a Glock 26 subcompact Pistol and a spare magazine.</item>
        <item>A wood carrying case. Inside are a Smith &amp; Wesson M76 9mm submachine gun and a pair of Browning Hi-Power 9mm semi-automatics, set into recesses. There\'s also a pair of extra magazines for each pistol, a plastic ammo box containing 100 rounds of 9mm hollowpoints and, set into recesses in the interior of the lid of the case are 9 pairs of magazines for the M76, taped together "jungle style".</item>
        <item>A Taser X3 with five cartridges. The X3 cartridge holds 3 shots before it must be exchanged for a fresh one.</item>

        <item>A paperbag containing a fully loaded CZ75 9mm pistol and two extra magazines (both loaded).</item>
        <item>A Bohemian earspoon, a polearm with a forward-facing spear-like spike and two outward facing spikes. It\'s not an original medieval artifact but a replica that appears to have been produced by White Rose Armoury of England.</item>
        <item>A Ruger Super Redhawk in a black leather case; it is chambered for the high-powered .454 Casull round, and a box of 12 sits next to it. A box of .45 Long Colt, which can be fired from guns chambered for the .454, has also been included for less enthusiastic shooters.</item>
        <item>M-4 carbine with 5 magazines.</item>
        <item>A battered and slightly rusty 7.62x39mm AK47 rifle with a side-folding stock. Close examination reveals that it is very crudely made and finished, with sloppy machine work, and ugly bluish-green plastic tape wrapped around the pistol grip and handguards; an ARMORER skill roll reveals it is a "Khyber Pass" copy made out of scrap metal by Pathan gunsmiths in Pakistan. It is in good working order and safe to fire. There are also about a dozen rusty steel 30-round magazines with it, but no ammunition is present.</item>
        <item>A Chinese Type 56 assault rifle, loaded with twenty-four rounds of 7.62X29mm soft point bullets and caked with dry blood.</item>

        <item>A Rossi Model 851 6-shot .38 Special revolver with a 4-inch barrel.</item>
        <item>A bundle of 14 SKS 7.62mm rifles, in various states of condition and age wrapped with duct tape and all with erased serial numbers. About half of them are loaded, some are even chambered. The weapons have a envelope attached to a barrel by a string. The envelope says, "Clean and cheap guns, use one, drop, replace."</item>
        <item>A bloodstained handkerchief wrapped around a fully loaded (6 shot) Glock 36 .45 pistol with a 3.78" barrel. There is also a spare (loaded) magazine alongside the small gun.</item>
        <item>A British Army armament crate with a sturdy padlock, containing one mothballed and obsolete Blowpipe anti-aircraft missile launcher and two missiles. A note attached insists the users \'not waste\' the missiles, complaining of how difficult it was to get through customs.</item>

        <item>A .45 Ingram MAC-10 submachine gun with a screwed on suppressor. It is quite worn and have deep scratches along the handle. The clip contains 12 rounds.</item>
        <item>A Norwegian made Heckler &amp; Koch G3A1 rifle, with "Kongsberg, 7,62N, No83838" stamped into the metal. It has black electricians tape wound around the pistol grip, and a yellow plastic tag bearing the inscription: "Slethei" tied to the foregrip. One fully loaded 20 round clip is inserted.(If traced, this rifle is one of 15 stolen from Terningmoen camp in Norway in 1997.)</item>
        <item>This carton contains six small black plastic cases, each containing a Glock 22 .40 caliber pistol and three fifteen-round magazines. The serial numbers have been removed. There are also several boxes of .40 caliber hollowpoint ammunition and one partial box of armor piercing ammunition.</item>
        <item>A beautiful hand-made atlatl. It would look perfectly at home on the wall of an anthropology professor\'s office but the fire-hardened point of the spear and razor-sharp blades set along the tip speak to someone serious about getting the job done.</item>
        <item>One Springfield XD-40 pistol with 2 loaded magazines.</item>
        <item>A hunting knife with a twelve-inch blade, a large brass cross guard and wooden grips. The blade is slightly rusted and heavily pitted by what appears to be acid.</item>
        <item>A Finnish-made Tikkakoski M31 Suomi 9mm caliber carbine, comes with one 36 round stick magazine, two 71 round drums and s soft carrying case.</item>
        <item>A Ruger Redhawk .44 Magnum revolver, with 5.5" barrel. There are two fired and four unfired rounds in the drum.</item>

        <item>A 3 pack of bear mace. A sticky note attached to the package reads, "not just for bears."</item>
        <item>An empty 9mm Ruger SR9 pistol.</item>
        <item>A nickel plated Star Model B 9mm with pearl grips and two extra magazines and a chromed Auto-Ordnance M1911A1 .45 with pearl grips and two extra magazines.</item>
        <item>A paper bag containing eighteen .38 rounds.</item>
        <item>A burlap sack filled with several sickles, of varying degrees of quality and age. Most of them are rusty, and some with wooden handles are beginning to rot, but they seem to be well-balanced for fighting, and perhaps even throwing if the need were to arise.</item>
        <item>One Mossberg 590 pump shotgun, 9 shot capacity, with sling and 50 rounds 00 buckshot in a padded nylon firearm case. A note is in the case, handwritten on plain paper: "Leave this for the noobs. Hopefully they won\'t shoot you with it by accident."</item>
        <item>A Vz.52 pistol chambered in 7.62X25 Tokarev with a crude star etched in the grips and a single full 8-round magazine.</item>
        <item>A CZ 550 Safari Classic rifle chambered for .500 Jeffery rounds, pokes out of a roughed-up golf-bag. This bolt-action mammoth, designed for bringing down elephants and bruising the shoulders of even experienced shooters, takes 3 rounds internally. At the bottom of the golf bag are 10 rounds (worth about $50 altogether).\nA successful ARMORER roll (or after testing it) finds that the gun has been custom built for a specific user and anyone else firing it will suffer a 15% penalty to their RIFLE skill.</item>
        <item>A first generation (1970s) Charter Arms Bulldog .44 Special revolver with a 2.5-inch barrel. Comes with a holster, ten defensive hollow-point rounds and a speed-loader.</item>
        <item>A M224 60mm Mortar with four shells and the M8 base plate is attached which brings this monster down to 18 pounds but requires it be fired hand held. Only two of the shells are High Explosive the other two are Infrared Illumination rounds.</item>
        <item>A shipping crate with markings indicating that it contains an M60 machine gun. If opened, the box appears to be filled with kitty litter. If the litter is pushed aside, beneath it are several bottles of vegetable oil, karo syrup, a metal bottle marked, "DANGER: Contains Picric Acid (Wet)" and hand printed instructions for how to turn the box and its contents into an extremely hot and slow burning incendiary device.</item>
        <item>Two pairs of brass knuckles and one Bowie knife.</item>
        <item>Resting in a wooden case along with a leather sheath is a vintage Ithaca Auto &amp; Burglar Gun, a factory built 20-gauge shotgun-pistol with 10-inch smoothbore double-barrels and a contoured pistol grip that comes to a total of 16 inches in length. Only a few thosand were manufactured before Ithaca discontinued it in the wake of the 1934 National Firearms act. It only takes 2 3/4 inch shells.</item>
        <item>A small, uncomfortable mattress of the type found in college dorms or prisons. Made all the more uncomfortable by the fact that someone has hollowed out a football-sized area and filled it with half a dozen Ka-Bar knives.</item>
        <item>A .357 Magnum revolver in mint (i.e., never before used) condition nestled in a finely finished wooden box lined with ice blue crushed velvet. Also in the box are a dozen rounds for the weapon. Inlaid in gold leaf on the lid of the box are the words "Miss Snuggle-bunny" in cheesy Country-Western script.</item>
        <item>A set of brass knuckles with the word "punish" crudely scratched onto their backs, probably with a knife.</item>
        <item>A plastic bag with assorted pistol ammunition (twenty-two 9mm, twelve .38, forty .22, nine .45, four .44 magnum and eight .357 Magnum).</item>
        <item>A J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn "Western Marshal" single-action revolver chambered for .357 Magnum; this Colt Peacemaker clone, manufactured in West Germany in the 1960s has a six-inch barrel and rosewood grips.</item>
        <item>An AGM-114 Hellfire air to surface missile. Stolen from an airbase in Iraq, it was reported as damaged and destroyed as unstable. It lacks everything you\'d need to use the weapon as intended.</item>
        <item>A pair of worn leather saddle-bags; one containing an empty Glock 17 9mm pistol, the other containing an opened box of 9mm ammunition with twelve rounds left,</item>
        <item>A pistol case containing a Bersa Thunder 9 9mm pistol and two spare 17 round magazines loaded with hollowpoint rounds.</item>
        <item>Eight unopened 50-round boxes of CCI Blazer .45 ACP 230-grain FMJ ammunition.</item>
        <item>A replacement tire and wheel for a large pickup truck (F350 or F250). It\'s much heavier than usual. If one were to pull the tire away from the rim, one would note that it is packed full of C4, not inflated with air. A compact radio detonation assembly has been squished into a crevice in the C4, and can be armed by unscrewing the cap on the valve stem (removing the magnet from a normally-open reed switch).\nSome wonk has written on the chassis-facing side of the wheel "Well, there\'s your problem!" in feltpen.</item>
        <item>An extremely tacky sword-cane, with a little crystal human skull at the top. The release switch sticks a little, but the blade is sharp.</item>
        <item>A crude one-shot zip-gun chambered for a .32 round. It is not loaded.</item>
        <item>A plastic bag containing a fully loaded (8 rounds) Hi-Point C-9 9mm pistol and an opened paper box with seventeen 9mm rounds left. The small gun has been meticulously cleaned of all finger-prints, both external and internal.</item>
        <item>1 AR15 (20-inch barrel, A4-style upper) with attached EOTech and backup iron-sights.\n3 30-round magazines loaded with M885 \'Penetrator\' 5.56 NATO ammunition.</item>
        <item>This long plastic case contains, in addition to a number of packets of silica gel to absorb moisture, a heavy-barreled bolt-action rifle. A successful ARMORER roll will tell the player that it appears to have been built using a postwar Mauser commercial action, and is built to a general pattern--very heavy barrel, spring-loaded scope mounts to protect a delicate target scope from heavy recoil, straight-grain walnut stock--that was back around 1960 very popular among long-range target shooting competitors in the US and Europe. It is also completely free of serial numbers or manufacturers\' markings. It shows signs of use but is clean and lightly oiled. It has an old, possibly European-looking (but unmarked, of course) 20x target scope in the spring-loaded mounts and is in caliber .300 Holland &amp; Holland Magnum. Also present are several unmarked pasteboard boxes each containing twenty rounds of hand-loaded match-grade ammunition with hollowpoint bullets in .300 H&amp;H Mag and a notebook containing trajectory and wind drift data for this ammunition in this rifle out to 1200 meters. Notebook says the rifle is zeroed at 500 meters and has instructions to change the zero point from any point from less than 100m to 1200m.</item>
        <item>A box containing twenty-five .32 rounds.</item>
        <item>2 suppressed Ingram MAC-11 .380 ACP machine pistols, each with an extra clip. (These need to be cleaned before use or there is x4 the normal chance for an accident)</item>
        <item>Two fully-loaded and well-kept ArmaLite AR-18/180s wrapped in sackcloth. Serial numbers show they were manufactured in Japan under license. However, the FBI and the British authorities can link the weapons to an IRA attack on a Belfast pub in 1978 which left five civilians and a British soldier dead.</item>
        <item>A small box stuffed with sticks of dynamite and primacord.</item>
        <item>A scuffed leather pouch containing a fully loaded Ruger Blackhawk .44 Magnum revolver with 4 5/8" barrel, as well as twelve loose .44 Magnum rounds.</item>
        <item>An old sock containing an M84 Stun grenade.</item>
        <item>Six missiles for the FIM-92 Stinger shoulder-fired surface to air missile system, in an unopened US Army ordnance crate. There is no launcher, but they could still be useful for the production of IEDs.</item>
        <item>Hanging unevenly on the wall is a Pink Floyd poster. Lifting it up reveals a Madsen M50 hanging from a hook behind it.</item>
        <item>The parts of an AR-15, distributed and concealed within a rolled-up rug, a coffee can, and a cereal box. About twenty rounds are also present, wrapped in a cloth and placed in a cashew can.</item>
        <item>2 Model 7290 flashbang grenades.</item>
        <item>An opened box of .357 Magnum hollowpoints. Contains only 8 rounds.</item>
        <item>A piece of PVC piping approximately three inches in diameter, a coiled piece of extremely thin wire, a small metal pulley, and four fragmentation grenades. The PVC piping has been spraypainted in camouflage colors, and one side is plugged with a very loose stopper tied to one end of the wire. Appropriate rolls would deduce that this is a booby trap kit similar to ones used by the Viet Cong, in which the pins of the grenades are pulled, then crammed into the pipe. The walls of the pipe keep the safety lever of the grenades from detaching until the tripwire is triggered, removing the stopper and letting the grenades roll out.</item>
        <item>Harrington &amp; Richardson 622 six-shot .22LR revolver with a 6-inch barrel; comes with a belt holster rig.</item>
        <item>A black plastic box containing an empty Ruger P89 9mm pistol and an (empty) extra magazine.</item>
        <item>A black leather shoulder-holster containing a fully loaded Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan .44 Magnum revolver with a 2.5" barrel and black rubber grip.</item>
        <item>A table leg, with the bottom portion wrapped in electrical tape. Wear and tear suggests it was used as an improvised club.</item>
        <item>A single high explosive round for a British 30 mm ADEN aircraft cannon. The round was manufactured in 1983, but remains stable and viable.</item>
        <item>A high end sporting crossbow, fitted with a light-amplifying scope and a quiver of 16 broadhead composite-shafted bolts.</item>
        <item>a 5-foot long walking staff made of gnarled oak. The words "Hittin\' Stick" are engraved on the top. The bottom third has recently been sanded and re-varnished.</item>
        <item>A can of Pringles potato chips stuffed with homemade C1 Explosive compound.</item>
        <item>Roll of quarters</item>
        <item>A box of twenty 9mm rounds.</item>
        <item>Collection of small pistols in their original boxes with a single magazine each.\n- A Jennings Model J-25 .25 ACP\n- A Bryco 38 .380 ACP.\n- A Tanfoglio Model GT27 .25 ACP\n- A Lorcin L32 .32 ACP\n- An FIE Titan Tiger .25 ACP\n- A Sundance Industries BOA .25 ACP</item>
        <item>A custom rifle case containing a LaRue Tactical OBR carbine with a 12" barrel, chambered for 5.56mm. An EOTech XPS3 holographic weapon sight is mounted on top. There are five black polymer Magpul magazines in the case, each loaded with 28 rounds of Black Hills 77-grain OTM (Open Tip Match)</item>
        <item>A well maintained and polished Marlin Model 1895 lever action rifle, chambered for .45-70. The stock of the gun has a number of cheap beads and a dream-catcher tied to it and "Big Medicine" as been very carefully engraved into the stock. It is unloaded by a dozen .45-70 JSP rounds are found standing in a line next to the gun.</item>
        <item>A Buck knife with stag horn grips and an acid-etched image of a winged serpent on the blade.</item>
        <item>A crudely and apparently hastily assembled piercing weapon made out of a fancy metal pen with a small knitting needle snapped off and jammed inside. The part that would separate has been super-glued shut.\nOn the side of the pen is "Happy 5th Anniversary" The weapon is very slightly bent and there are flecks of blood someone neglected to wash off the tip.</item>
        <item>A sizable survival knife has been lashed with parachute cord to the end of a roughly-hewn oak limb, creating an improvised spear. Anyone who watches survival shows would recognize this as a favored technique of Survivorman star Les Stroud.</item>
        <item>A makeshift knife made out of a sharpened toothbrush and wrapped with a duct-tape handle. It will pass through a metal detector.</item>
        <item>A 9 iron with the words "A man chooses, a slave obeys" engraved on the club face.</item>
        <item>One WWII-era Finnish Mosin M39 rifle, chambered for 7.62x54R., featuring adjustable sights and a canvas-and-leather sling. A box of 20 FMJ rounds is also with the rifle. The weapon (one of the many Finnish factory reworks of captured or purchased Mosin M/91 rifles) is in exceltent condition.</item>
        <item>A olive drab duffel bag, which contains a Heckler &amp; Koch PSG1A1 Sniper Rifle. Also inside the duffel are two 20-round magazines.</item>
        <item>A potato gun that seems to have been retrofit for an actual magazine of three potatoes</item>
        <item>A paper box with fifty .32 rounds.</item>
        <item>A Russian made TM-62M anti-tank mine. Normally it requires a pressure of 200kg to detonate. However this has been modified with a MS-3 anti-personnel mine so that it will detonate with a pressure of just 6kg.</item>
        <item>An adjustable black leather shoulder-holster containing a fully loaded Springfield Armory 1911 .45 pistol with stainless steel finish.</item>

        <item>A well-preserved British Sterling Submachine Gun (9x19mm) wrapped in an oilcloth, along with a pair of empty 34-round magazines.\nSome joker with a mind for trivia has taken the time to etch "This machine kills Rebel scum!" below the receiver, and filled the letters in with white lacquer.</item>

        <item>A medium-sized metal case, about the size of a traveling trunk, on the outside there is some stuff printed or labeled in French. Opening it up reveals five FAMAS F1 assault rifles, which appear to be French military surplus. Each weapon is fully loaded (25 rounds), and has two spare magazines. These rifles are particularly confusing, as a serial number check shows them to be in inventory in a Alaskan National Guard Armory, but the French shipping information on the outside says it was sent to a non-existent Army base in Alaska.</item>

        <item>A Knight\'s Armament SR-25 7.62x51 NATO semi-automatic sniper rifle - featuring a Harris bipod, a Leupold Mark 4 LR/T M1 riflescope, a suppressor and four 20-round box magazines.</item>

        <item>This cardboard box contains six M18A1 "Claymore" antipersonnel mines. Tracing the serial numbers reveals that they were recorded as having been expended in a live-fire exercise at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1984.</item>
        <item>A .40 caliber Beretta 96 resting in a foam-lined case, with two spare clips.</item>
        <item>Four cheap cast-potmetal .22 caliber pistols--two revolvers and two shiny, if scratched-up, nickel-plated semiautos with spare magazines and a few partial boxes of .22 ammo. All four are cheaply, crudely made, and have seen better days. A successful ARMORER skill roll will tell the player that the guns are in poor mechanical condition and likely to misfire, jam, or otherwise malfunction when used. Guns will fail to fire and jam on a roll of 1 on 1d6.</item>
        <item>A box of twenty .32 rounds.</item>
        <item>A brand new Schrade pocketknife with a 2" blade.</item>
        <item>Five red dot sights that disappeared from a unit returning from Iraq in 2009.</item>
        <item>A black briefcase, with a form fitting foam lining, containing a Glock 21 .45 ACP pistol, 5 13 round magazines loaded with FMJ ammo, a silencer, a Kydex holster, and a Kydex dual magazine pouch. The Glock contains an RFID chip in the grip. A trace of the Glocks serial number indicates it was purchased by Wackenhut Security. The silencer is of professional quality, but bears no serial number ( and is therefore highly illegal ).</item>
        <item>A small wooden box containing a Russian PMN-2 anti-personnel mine.</item>

There are neither manufacturers\' markings nor signs of their removal on the gun or its accessories, suggesting it was fabricated specially for a government black-op.\nA massive suppressor is attached to the weapon, very nearly longer than the barrel itself. However, it is just as efficient as one would expect for its size.</item>
        <item>A two feet long carefully sharpened and fire-hardened hawthorn stake.</item>
        <item>A crate containing an M1917 water-cooled Browning machine gun, in .30-06. Also in the crate are: Four empty 250-round cloth belts, a belt loading machine, an ammunition box, manual, tripod, and water-condensing hoses and can.</item>

        <item>A Millwall brick; a sort of improvised weapon made from newspaper sheets (in this case this particular brick is made from a local newspaper) rolled and folded to create a handle (a haft) and a rounded head at the fold, to be used like a cosh.</item>
        <item>A blue Nike gym-bag containing :\n- one Beretta 92G Centurion 9mm pistol + 2 extra clips.\n- one Glock 34 9mm pistol + 2 extra clips.\n- one Colt Anaconda .44 Magnum revolver.\n- one Ruger MP9 submachine gun + 1 extra mag.\n- one Armscor M30R8 12 gauge shotgun.\n- 4 boxes of 9mm ammunition (200 rounds).\n- 1 box of .44 Magnum ammunition (25 rounds).\n- 1 box of 12 gauge shotgun shells (20 rounds of 00 buckshot)\n- five black ski-masks.</item>
        <item>A plastic bag with six 12 gauge shotgun slugs in it.</item>

        <item>An American Arms Gentry 28 gauge double barrelled shotgun with 26-inch barrels.</item>
        <item>On one of the walls is a peg-board on which hang two or three dozen fixed blade knives with sheaths. They are in various styles and range from small and easily concealable to a few approaching short sword dimensions.\nA note pinned to the board reads "Rule #9"</item>
        <item>A second one in a different hand reads "Knives: Killing stuff for 2.5 million years and counting."</item>
        <item>A small .22 caliber derringer, plated in silver, bearing genuine ivory handles, and covered in ornate engravings. The decorations are rather Arabesque, and masterful in craftsmanship, but what seems to have been a dedication has been violently defaced, ruining its value.</item>
        <item>An empty Taurus Model 65 .357 Magnum revolver with a 4" barrel. The gun comes with a cheap leather shoulder-holster. .38 ammunition would work fine in it as well.</item>
        <item>An opened box of .40S&amp;W handgun ammunition. Twelve rounds remains.</item>
        <item>A two litre glass bottle filled with clear liquid. A hand-written label on its side says "Hydrocloric Acid 38%, handle with care".</item>

        <item>In a wooden presentation case, one Heckler And Koch P7M8 pistol with Karl Nill wood grips. The slides top left edge is engraved with "76 von 500."</item>
        <item>A Ruger No. 1 single-shot rifle chambered in .45-70, sawed down to the point that it can easily be concealed beneath a jacket. A rubber strap has been mounted on the back end of the stock, so that it can be hung from the shoulder and tucked under the arm.</item>
        <item>A set of boxes that hold the components of a disassembled Lahti L-39, a Finnish 20mm anti-tank rifle manufactured during the Second World War. Fully assembled, the rifle is 88 inches long and weighs 109 pounds empty. One of the boxes contains a wooden ski-folding bipod mount that attaches to the bottom of the gun. Two large triangular flat-bottomed steel boxes with carrying straps are among the gear. Inside each of the boxes are two black-metal magazines holding ten rounds each.

It is in need of maintenance and will only work for twelve more shots before it stops suppressing the noise. Disassembling it will reveal that instead of steel baffles or a spiral gas diffuser inside, it is a WWII-era "wet" type unit, with a sheet of asbestos cloth smeared with axle grease wrapped around the perforated central spindle. A successful ARMORER roll will be needed to clean the asbestos cloth without damaging it then reapply the axle grease properly, then reassemble the unit correctly, after which it will work for another very roughly one hundred shots, more with a .22, less with full-auto fire.</item>

        <item>Wrapped in a greasy old oiled cloth are a very worn, rather old-looking semiauto pistol and three magazines that fit it. The only markings on the pistol are "RUBY" stamped on the side of the slide and "7.65mm" on the exposed portion of the barrel visible through the ejection port. No serial number is present, nor is there ammunition for it in the drawer where it was found. A successful ARMORER skill roll will tell the player that tens of thousands of cheaply made pistols like this one were manufactured in an assortment of small factories in Spain and exported to France for military issue during the First World War, that they were not well made by the standards of the time, that parts don\'t necessarily interchange between two similar-looking RUBY pistols, and that it uses the still relatively common .32 ACP/7.65mm Browning Short pistol cartridge. It holds eight in the magazine plus one in the chamber, though it is probably not safe to carry it with a cartridge ca. The user is entitled to a Luck roll to see whether it will jam or misfire when used, or whether it will fire accidentally if dropped.</item>
